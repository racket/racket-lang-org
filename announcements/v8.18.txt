Racket v8.18

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- The racket-lang.org website no longer distributes Racket BC bundles,
  but it includes pre-built bundles for two flavors of ARM linux,
  AArch64 and 32-bit ARMv6 VFP.
- XML structures are serializable.
- Scribble's HTML generation conforms better to modern standards.
- Racket uses Unicode 16.0 for character and string operations.
- The `redex-check` default generation strategy always uses random
  generation to supplement the enumerator.
- DrRacket supports the use of shift-tab to go backward to previous
  indentation positions.
- The macro stepper supports the string-constants library, allowing
  internationalization of the stepper itself.
- The `struct` form supports `#:properties prop-list-expr`, making it
  more convenient to attach multiple property values to a structure
  type.
- Build-system improvements support containers registered at Docker
  Hub to build for all platforms that have downloads from the main
  Racket download site; improvements also support Unix-style builds
  for Mac OS in the style of MacPorts.
- The `expt` function produces a more accurate result when its first
  argument is a flonum and its second argument is an exact integer
  that has no equivalent flonum representation than it did in prior
  versions.
- TCP ports use `SO_KEEPALIVE` correctly.
- Unsafe code can use “uninterruptible mode” instead of “atomic mode”
  to allow futures to run concurrently while preventing interruptions
  from other threads.
- The `net/imap` library supports IMAP's `move` operation.
- There are many other repairs and documentation improvements!
