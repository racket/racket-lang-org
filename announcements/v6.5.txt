Racket v6.5

- Typed Racket and the racket/contract library generate code with lower
  overhead, speeding up typed/untyped interaction in a number of gradual
  typing programs we studied.

- Macros written using `syntax-parse` automatically emit more accurate
  error messages.

- The contract profiler captures costs from more contract combinators,
  including all those in the main distribution.

- Hash table and set iteration, via both existing and new non-generic
  sequences, is more performant, up to twice as fast on microbenchmarks.

- The Racket optimizer detects many more optimization opportunities,
  including when variables always hold numbers.

- The `db` library supports multi-result statements in MySQL.

- The `net/dns` library supports SRV records.

- The `racket/unix-socket` library supports listen and accept operations.
