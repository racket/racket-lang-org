Racket v9.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Documentation organization and navigation can be specialized by
  language family, to allow users to interact with documentation in a
  way that is tailored to that language family. This is currently used
  by Rhombus.
- The `for` form and its variants accept an `#:on-length-mismatch`
  specifier. 3.18 Iterations and Comprehensions: for, for/list, ...
- DrRacket improves the GUI for choosing color schemes.
- DrRacket has curved syntax arrows. The degree of curvature indicates
  the relative left- or right-displacement of the arrow's target.
- DrRacket's "Insert Large Letters" uses characters that match the
  comment syntax of the buffer's language, making it useful (and fun!)
  in Rhombus.
- The `exn-classify-errno` maps network and filesystem error numbers
  on various platforms to posix-standard symbols, to enable more
  portable code. 10.2 Exceptions
- The behavior of Racket BC on certain character operations (most
  notably `eq?`)  is changed to match that of Racket CS, with a small
  performance penalty for these operations for BC programs. 19
  Performance 1.5 Implementations
- The `make-struct-type` procedure can inherit the current inspector
  using a `'current` flag. This is the default behavior, but there are
  situations in which it's not possible to refer to the current
  inspector. 5.2 Creating Structure Types
- Bundle configurations can better control the conventions for
  locating shared object files with the `--enable-sofind=<conv>`
  flags.
- The `system-type` function can report on platform and
  shared-object-library conventions with new flags. 15.8 Environment
  and Runtime Information
- The `openssl/legacy` library makes it possible to access OpenSSL's
  built-in "legacy" provider, to get access to insecure and outdated
  algorithms. OpenSSL: Secure Communication
- Typed Racket improves expected type propagation for keyword argument
  functions.
- There are many other repairs and documentation improvements!
