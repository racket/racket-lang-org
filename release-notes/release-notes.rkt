@bullet{The new @link[dr-core-url]{`drracket-core`} package provides a version of drracket with
   a smaller set of dependencies.}

@bullet{Typed Racket has support for @link[(rur "treelist.html")]{treelists}.}

@bullet{The package manager computes @link[(dur "pkg/Package_Concepts.html")]{checksums} for packages when required,
   allowing the use and automatic upgrade of packages without them.}

@bullet{The @link[bfs-url]{`bitwise-first-bit-set`} function returns the smallest bit that is
   set in the twos-complement representation of the given number.}

@bullet{The updated @link[(rur "Module_Names_and_Loading.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._dynamic-require%29%29")]{`dynamic-require`} function makes it easier to use
   syntax bindings by allowing a syntax-thunk (or 'eval) to be used for them.}

@bullet{The @link[(rur "exns.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._error-module-path-~3estring-handler%29%29")]{`error-module-path->string-handler`} parameter allows the customization
   of the display of module-paths in error messages.}

@bullet{Precision of certain @link[(rur "generic-numbers.html")]{numeric functions} (`sin`, `cos`, and others) is
   improved on Windows platforms by using the MSVCRT/UCRT libraries.}
  
@bullet{The @link[(rur "strings.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._string-append%29%29")]{`string-append`} function has improved performance and reduced memory
   use for long lists of strings in the Racket CS implementation.
   Differences are clearly noticeable for lists of length 1 million.}

@bullet{@link[(rur "tcp.html")]{TCP ports} use `SO_KEEPALIVE`, instructing the kernel to send periodic
   messages while waiting for data to check whether the connection
   is still responsive.}

@bullet{Racket code using a terminal in Windows can receive mouse events as
 virtual terminal characters after using SetConsoleMode. (This is also
 already possible on macOS and Linux.) See the
 @link["https://docs.racket-lang.org/tui-term/index.html"]{tui-term} package
 for related example code.}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "json/index.html#%28part._.Parsing_.J.S.O.N_.Text_into_.J.S-.Expressions%29")]{`#:replace-malformed-surrogate?`} keyword can be used to specify
   a replacement for malformed unicode surrogates in JSON input}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "http-client/index.html")]{http-client} module no longer sends "Content-Length: 0" for
   requests without a body.}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "raco/demod.html")]{demodularizer} (`compiler/demod`) can prune more unused assignments}

@bullet{Several judgment rendering forms in @link[(dur "redex/index.html")]{Redex} are replaced by functions, allowing
   more convenient abstraction.}

@bullet{When a distribution includes no teaching languages, DrRacket’s language-dialog
 configuration moves into the preferences dialog and the “Language” menu disappears.}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "math/index.html")]{math library} has better support for block-diagonal matrices, including
 both Racket and Typed Racket.}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "math/index.html")]{math library} contains improved implementations of acos and
   matrix-(cos-)angle.}

@bullet{The @link[(dur "stepper/index.html")]{stepper} again works for @link[(dur "teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#(part._world._interactive)")]{`big-bang`} programs.}

@bullet{There are many other repairs and documentation imprevements!
}



@;{   @sub-bullet{@link[(rur "treelist.html#%28part._.Mutable_.Treelists%29")]{Mutable treelists} are @link[(rur "serialization.html")]{serializable}.}}
