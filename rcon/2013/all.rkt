    @p*{@b{RacketCon} is a public meeting for everyone interested in Racket:
        developers, contributors, programmers, educators, and by-standers.  It
        is an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to
        share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm.  RacketCon will enable the entire
        Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to
        collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.

    @h4{Dan Liebgold (@a[href: "http://www.naughtydog.com/"]{Naughty Dog})}
    @h5{Racket on the Playstation 3? It's Not What you Think!}
    @h5{Abstract}
    @p{In this talk I will give a brief overview of DC, a custom data scripting
       system developed in Racket at Naughty Dog. It has been an essential tool
       for us to develop games for Playstation 3.}
    @p{When developing our codebase for the Playstation 3 we decided we needed a
       comprehensive scripting system to enable the creation of significant
       amounts of customized data typically necessary to develop a Naughty Dog
       game. Using C++ in conjunction with off the shelf tools like Maya,
       Photoshop, and even internal custom game layout tools usually leaves many
       large gaps in our ability to piece together the game design we envision.}
    @p{As a result we selected Racket (then MzScheme) as a platform upon which to
       develop a system that provided the abilities we needed. In our Racket based
       system (DC), we develop a multitude of domain specific languages, a
       powerful gameplay scripting system, and systems for implementing animation,
       effects, and sound.}
    @p{My talk will give a brief overview of our experience at Naughty Dog
       building this system on top of Racket. I'll cover the nuts and bolts of how
       our system works. I'll cover the challenges of C++ programmers utilizing
       Racket while under the deadlines of retail software development. I’ll talk
       about the many opportunities this approach afforded us, some of which we
       were able to capitalize on to great success, others which lay tantalizingly
       just out of reach. I’ll talk about the culture clash of getting C++
       programmers, technical game designers, and non-technical artists to be
       productive in a world of S-expressions and syntax transformations. And I’ll
       give an overview of some metrics of the impressive contributions our system
       was able to make to the development of "Uncharted" series of games and "The
       Last of Us" for the Playstation 3.}
    @h5{About the Speaker}
    @p{Dan Liebgold has programmed games in one form or another for most of his
       life, starting on an Apple II in 4th grade. He has worked as a
       professional game programmer for 17 years, 11 of them at Naughty Dog, Inc.
       Some of the games he's contributed to are: Starcraft, Sacrifice, the Jak &
       Daxter series and the Uncharted series.}

    @p{RacketCon will be held in @b{West Village H, Room 108}, at
       Northeastern University.  West Village H is located
       at 440 Huntington Ave, Boston Massachusetts, and is building
       @a[href: "http://www.northeastern.edu/campusmap/map/qad4.html"]{#23H} on
