@talk{@code{#lang Karp}: Formulating and Random Testing NP Reductions}
#:more
@abstract{
Reduction, a pervasive idea in computer science, is often
taught in algorithm courses with NP problems. The
traditional pen-and-paper approach is notoriously
ineffective both for students and instructors: Subtle
mistakes in reductions are often hard to detect by merely
inspecting the purported solutions. Constructing a
counterexample by hand to expose the mistake is even more
onerous. Based on the observation that reductions are
actually programs, we designed @code{#lang Karp}, a DSL for
formulating and random testing NP reductions. In this talk,
I’m going to discuss the implementation of Karp on top of
Racket and solver-aided host language @a[#:href "https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/index.html"]{Rosette}.

@talk{Incrementally Developing Support for Racket->Wasm Compilation}
#:more
@abstract{
Wasm is an attractive compiler target for a variety of reasons: it has support in all major browsers, its isolation guarantees are beneficial for security reasons, and it has potential as a general-purpose platform-independent execution environment. However, adding Wasm support to Racket has proven a challenging problem due to differences in the execution model each language uses at runtime. Chez Scheme, the backend of Racket CS, utilizes code generation conventions which are difficult to adapt to Wasm. This talk will present an alternative approach to Racket-to-Wasm compilation which is compatible with Racket CS. The approach is accomplished by using an existing bytecode format and interpreter which are already supported under Chez Scheme, and performing an ahead-of-time translation of portions of bytecode programs into Wasm. This sets up an incremental approach to the development of a Racket-to-Wasm compilation system.

@talk{Teaching and Learning Compilers Incrementally}
#:more
@abstract{
This talk is an introduction to the joys of teaching and
learning about compilers using the incremental approach. The talk
provides a sneak-preview of a compiler course based on the new
textbooks from MIT Press, @book-title{Essentials of Compilation: An Incremental
Approach in @a[#:href "https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047760/essentials-of-compilation/"]{Racket}/@a[#:href "https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048248/essentials-of-compilation/"]{Python}}.
The course takes students on a journey
through constructing their own compiler for a small but powerful
language.  The standard approach to describing and teaching compilers
is to proceed one pass at a time, from the front to the back of the
compiler. Unfortunately, that approach obfuscates how language
features motivate design choices in a compiler. In this course we
instead take an incremental approach in which we build a complete
compiler every two weeks, starting with a small input language that
includes only arithmetic and variables. We add new language features
in subsequent iterations, extending the compiler as necessary.
Students get immediate positive feedback as they see their compiler
passing test cases and then learn important lessons regarding software
engineering as they grow and refactor their compiler throughout the
semester.

@abstract{
We discuss the design of a deep learning toolkit, @a[#:href "https://github.com/themetaschemer/malt"]{Malt}, that has been built for Racket. Originally designed to support the pedagogy of @a[#:href "https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546379/the-little-learner/"]{@book-title{The Little Learner—A Straight Line to Deep Learning}}, it is used to build deep neural networks with a minimum of fuss using tools like higher-order automatic differentiation and rank polymorphism.  The natural, functional style of AI programming that Malt enables can be extended to much  larger, practical applications. We present a roadmap for how we hope to achieve this so that it can become a stepping stone to allow Lisp/Scheme/Racket to reclaim the crown of being @emph{the} language for Artificial Intelligence (perhaps!).

Come see how it all works and how you can simplify your code with struct-plus-plus!}
