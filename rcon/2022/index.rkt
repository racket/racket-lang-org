#:more
@abstract{
@(a #:href "https://webassembly.org" "WebAssembly") is a compact, well-specified bytecode format that offers a portable compilation target with near-native execution speed. The bytecode format was specifically designed to be fast to parse, validate, and compile, positioning itself as a portable alternative to native code. It was pointedly not designed to be @(em "interpreted") directly. Instead, most engines have focused on optimized JIT compilation for maximum performance. Yet compilation time and memory consumption critically impact application startup, leading many Wasm engines to now employ two compilers. But interpreters start up even faster. A typical interpreter being infeasible, some engines resort to compiling Wasm not to machine code, but to a more compact, but easy to interpret format. This still takes time and wastes memory. Instead, we introduce a new design for an in-place interpreter for WebAssembly, where no rewrite and no separate format is necessary. Our measurements show that in-place interpretation of Wasm code is space-efficient and fast, achieving performance on-par with interpreting a custom-designed internal format. This fills a hole in the execution tier space for Wasm, allowing for even faster startup and lower memory footprint than previous engine configurations.

@bio{Ben L. Titzer is a Principal Researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.

#:more
@abstract{
Typed Racket (TR) is powerful—but sometimes too powerful. In addition to a
type checker and type-driven optimizer, it includes a contract layer that
dynamically monitors interactions with untyped code. The contracts make TR one
of the strongest and most flexible type systems in the world, but also one
of the slowest when there are many boundaries to untyped.

Shallow TR and Optional TR are two alternatives that have (finally!) arrived
with the Racket 8.7 release. Shallow TR enforces types with local assertions
rather than compositional contracts, keeping a bit of soundness at low cost.
Optional TR enforces types with nothing at all. This talk will explain Shallow
and Optional in depth and show how they can interact with untyped code,
standard TR, and each another.

systems and logics. Next Fall, he will be an assistant professor at the

Resyntax is a tool that wields the power of Racket’s macro expander to analyze Racket code and suggest improvements. It uses a domain-specific language to specify refactoring rules in terms of syntax-parse macros. Rules explain why they’re improvements, allowing Resyntax to teach users how to make their code more straightforward, more readable, and more efficient. This talk covers how Resyntax works, why it’s different from tools like code formatters and linters, and what it means for the future of Racket’s static analysis ecosystem.

#:more
@abstract{
Beginners need to learn important Computer Science concepts revolving around problem solving, program design, modularity, documentation, testing, efficiency, running time, and program refinement. This presents unique challenges given students that are enthusiastic but have little experience quickly lose interest. Instructors must capture their imagination to channel their enthusiasm into learning the important lessons. An effective medium to do so is the development of video games. This talk outlines a design-based curriculum for beginners that is based on video game development.

@bio{Dr. Marco T. Morazán joined Seton Hall in 1999. He did his undergraduate studies at Rutgers University and his graduate work at the City University of New York. At Seton Hall he teaches at all levels of the Computer Science curriculum including his signature courses: @emph{Introduction to Program Design} I and II, @emph{Organization of Programming Languages}, and @emph{Automata Theory and Computability}. His main research foci are the implementation of programming languages and Computer Science Education. As the graduate school advisor, he takes special pride in making sure that his students are prepared to continue studies outside of Seton Hall. Dr. Morazán is a strong proponent of undergraduate research opportunities and routinely has students collaborate with him on projects. Along with his undergraduate research students, he is responsible for an optimal lambda lifting algorithm and an effective mechanism for closure memoization. In Computer Science education, he is especially proud of the effectiveness of the Computer Science curriculum, based on the development of video games, he has developed for beginners.}

#:more
@abstract{
The @emph{How to Design Programs} (@(a #:href "htdp.org" "HtDP")) curriculum,
utilizing simple subsets of the Racket programming language, teaches
the fundamentals of data-driven program design using the @q{design recipe}.
This approach teaches recursion by structural decomposition of
the input data, enough to express many algorithms on simple recursive
data structures. Furthermore, this approach is deeply mechanical,
having students write a @q{template} depending on the input type of the
function that when filled in produces structurally-recursive programs.

We present a work-in-progress program synthesizer for the HtDP Student
languages, @(a #:href "https://github.com/ralsei/bingus" "Bingus"), that utilizes the design recipe as its primary means
of generating programs. By parsing the signature (specification in a
comment) of a function, the first step of the design recipe, Bingus
makes guesses depending on the signatures of the function inputs,
utilizing the check-expects (unit tests) to determine when synthesis is
complete.

We demonstrate usage of Bingus as a program synthesis tool integrated
into DrRacket, and discuss ways that we plan to extend this tool for
pedagogic purposes, such as providing better feedback to students from
an auto-grader, or determining when student-provided unit tests are
insufficient.

@abstract{
Racketeers often use contracts to express the obligations that their libraries
impose on, or promise to, clients. While Racket’s contract system can handle
many specifications, it cannot naturally express protocols. For example,
a specification may constrain the permitted call sequence of functions,
or the context in which functions may be applied. This talk will present
several extensions to Racket’s contract system that attempt to fill this gap.
