RacketCon is a public meeting for everyone interested in Racket: developers, contributors, programmers, educators, and bystanders. It's an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm. RacketCon will enable the entire Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.

The creation of a programming language calls for guiding principles that point its developers to goals. This talk will spell out the three basic principles behind the 20-year development of Racket. First, programming is about stating and solving problems, and this activity normally takes place in a context with its own language of discourse; good programmers ought to formulate this language as a programming language. Hence, Racket is a programming language for creating new programming languages. Second, by following this language-oriented approach to programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of interconnected components. Each language and component must be able to protect its specific invariants. In support, Racket offers protection mechanisms to implement a full language spectrum, from C-level bit manipulation to soundly typed extensions. Third, because Racket considers programming as problem solving in the correct language, Racket also turns extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs, especially mechanisms for managing resources and projects. This talk will explain these principles and how Racket lives up to them, present the evaluation framework behind the design process, and conclude with a sketch of Racket's imperfections and opportunities for future improvements.

While object-oriented languages have embraced the use of advanced just-in-time compilers for fast execution, functional languages typically rely on ahead of time compilation/optmization.  Currently, there are no good JIT compilers for the Scheme family of languages, despite their successful application to other dynamic languages.  In this talk, I will present Pycket; an implementation of Racket in RPython which makes use of the meta-tracing JIT infrastructure developed for the PyPy project.  The goal of Pycket is to provide a fast Racket implementation which can eliminate the overhead of features which are difficult to optimize statically such as gradual typing, continuations, and contracts.

We made an in-browser music production and exploration platform. The backend was developed in Racket and C++; we just finished porting it to Typed Racket. I will talk about how using (typed) Racket has informed our design, some pitfalls we encountered, and what we're doing to make the backend both performant and reliable now that we have a few users.

I developed Rexcel for analyzing standardized test data for schools. Although I did if for a specific application, the approach I took was very general, making it easy for people to perform complex spreadsheet processing in a language other than VBA.

Using a Racket-based prototype to get our foot in the door, OntoPillot’s formal methods work is now in front of a Fortune 500 company to discuss possible collaboration. Using Racket’s compiler tools, including the syntax browser, we were able to create a credible prototype for a format methods tool development environment.

Using Racket, StarShine Academy has made galloping progress toward the software needed to win the Global Learning XPRIZE. StarShine Academy has developed learning-to-read prototypes in Racket that our reading expert mentors said they had been awaiting for a decade or more.  We have also begun work on a math learning prototype based on a world class math learning method from Canada.

I want to share the excitement of using the remarkable tools that the Racket community has developed, to create innovative applications that shake up the real world.

Racket's powerful syntax system allows things like pattern matching not only to be implemented as macros, but to be user-extensible as well. Match expanders, for example, allows users to extend Racket's pattern matcher with arbitrary new patterns. This talk discusses a generalized approach to match-expanders and its uses in defining macros with embedded user-extensible syntax, and shows an application of this approach to Racket's command line parsing forms.

Racket's macro expander evolved from a prototype circa 2000 that combined the `syntax-case` macro system with an idea for modules and phases. It has served Racket well, but the implementation is complex and difficult to explain in full, and it's starting to fray around the edges with the addition of submodules. The new macro expander starts over using a new way of representing and tracking bindings. The resulting model of macro expansion is simpler and more uniform than the current one based on renaming, but it's mostly compatible with the old expander.

Racket's ability to create languages is extremely versatile and powerful. No matter the challenge or problem domain, Racket's language tools provide a foundation for directly expressing and solving issues. We demonstrate by taming the age-old challenge of crafting a well-formed sonnet.

Typed Racket has enabled developers to enrich and optimize existing dynamically Typed Racket programs with static types. We have extended this system with practical dependent types that can verify a wider range of patterns commonly found in Racket code. I will demonstrate how this extension can help users remove more bugs and optimize more operations in their programs with little (if any) additional effort.

Racket encourages a functional style, but aside from immutable pairs, the collections library remains unsuitable for rich functional programming with a complement of functional data structures. Racket programmers may reach for linked lists when better structures would do to avoid the list-ref/vector-ref/stream-ref function zoo. This talk discusses the implementation of a generic collections system that encourages immutability by default, provides a more consistent and comprehensive interface across all data structures, and provides that interface in a way that can be leveraged by new, user-defined structures to feel as integrated with the language as Racket's built-ins.

422234004059019268090786172918417043456000 different arrangements or "NEStrations".

In randomized trials, we've found that audiences familiar with retro-style video game music can't tell Bithoven's compositions apart from "real" NES-era music. Yet, Bithoven contains almost no tuning for producing plausible retro-music and has fewer lines of code than the implementation of /bin/ls. In this talk, we'll discuss the beautiful Racket programming, elegant mathematics, and basic music theory that makes Bithoven work so well.

The GNU Image Manipulation Program, or GIMP, is an open-source alternative to Photoshop.  In the early days of GIMP, the designers added a scripting language, Script-Fu, based on Scheme.  Over the years, Script-Fu has been superseded by Python-Fu, although Script-Fu remains an option, albeit with a primitive IDE.  Over the past few years, my students and I have built a library that allows programmers to script GIMP using Racket and the DrRacket IDE.  In addition to providing the “glue” between GIMP and Racket, we also added a library of routines more amenable to novice programmers.  In this talk, we will discuss the design of both the “glue” and the broader library.  We will also discuss a related introductory course in CS that uses multiple models of image making as the motivating problem domain.
