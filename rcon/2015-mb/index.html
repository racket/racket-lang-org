It’s an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm. RacketCon will enable the entire Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.</p><h3><span id="register">Register</span></h3><p><a href="https://eventbrite.com/event/16825218682/">Via Eventbrite.</a></p><h3><span id="speakers">Keynote speaker</span></h3><div class="subhead foldable"><a href="javascript:toggle_div('g176')"><div class="keynote-speaker"><span class="speaker-name" decode="exclude"><span class="time"></span> Matthias Felleisen</span><span class="title">The Racket Manifesto</span></div></a></div><div style="display:none;" id="g176" class="payload"><p>The creation of a programming language calls for guiding principles that point its developers to goals. This talk will spell out the three basic principles behind the 20-year development of Racket. First, programming is about stating and solving problems, and this activity normally takes place in a context with its own language of discourse; good programmers ought to formulate this language as a programming language. Hence, Racket is a programming language for creating new programming languages. Second, by following this language-oriented approach to programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of interconnected components. Each language and component must be able to protect its specific invariants. In support, Racket offers protection mechanisms to implement a full language spectrum, from C-level bit manipulation to soundly typed extensions. Third, because Racket considers programming as problem solving in the correct language, Racket also turns extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs, especially mechanisms for managing resources and projects. This talk will explain these principles and how Racket lives up to them, present the evaluation framework behind the design process, and conclude with a sketch of Racket’s imperfections and opportunities for future improvements.</p><p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias">Matthias Felleisen</a> is the Chief Philosopher and Shepherd (CPS) of PLT Design, Inc.

Currently, there are no good JIT compilers for the Scheme family of languages, despite their successful application to other dynamic languages.  In this talk, I will present Pycket; an implementation of Racket in RPython which makes use of the meta-tracing JIT infrastructure developed for the PyPy project.  The goal of Pycket is to provide a fast Racket implementation which can eliminate the overhead of features which are difficult to optimize statically such as gradual typing, continuations, and contracts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sabauma">Spenser Bauman</a> is a Ph.D. student at Indiana University where he studies programming language theory and implementation with Sam Tobin-Hoschstadt and Jeremy Siek.

The backend was developed in Racket and C++; we just finished porting it to Typed Racket. I will talk about how using (typed) Racket has informed our design, some pitfalls we encountered, and what we’re doing to make the backend both performant and reliable now that we have a few users.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/m4burns">Marc Burns</a> studied math and computer science at the University of Waterloo.

Although I did if for a specific application, the approach I took was very general, making it easy for people to perform complex spreadsheet processing in a language other than VBA.</p><p>After his education at Caltech, MIT, Texas Instruments, Stanford (EE Ph.D), and Motorola, and after teaching medical informatics for five years at the Arizona School of Health Sciences, <a href="https://twitter.com/daviesaz">Byron Davies</a> worked at several startups before settling into a dual career at StarShine Academy, a K-12 charter school and laboratory for learning, and Ontopilot, a company using mathematical logic and specialized hardware to develop software that debugs other software.  Exclusively a Lisper since 1973, he developed the first general-purpose “twist-down” data browser, one of the first web applications for manufacturing (published in CACM), and—in Racket—the proof-of-concept prototype for OntoPilot’s Systems Integrity Analysis System.  His current goal is to implement, in Racket, the tablet-based software that will win the Global Learning XPRIZE.</p></div><div class="subhead foldable"><a href="javascript:toggle_div('g180')"><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name" decode="exclude"><span class="time"></span> Jack Firth</span><span class="title">Generic Syntax Expanders and Extensible Macros</span></div></a></div><div style="display:none;" id="g180" class="payload"><p>Racket’s powerful syntax system allows things like pattern matching not only to be implemented as macros, but to be user-extensible as well. Match expanders, for example, allows users to extend Racket’s pattern matcher with arbitrary new patterns. This talk discusses a generalized approach to match-expanders and its uses in defining macros with embedded user-extensible syntax, and shows an application of this approach to Racket’s command line parsing forms.</p><p><a href="http://codepen.io/Universalist/">Jack Firth</a> works at Mindjet in San Francisco as a developer of enterprise web applications and as a mentor to his colleagues on functional programming, particularly its applications to a Node / Angular stack.

His programming-related interests outside work include multi-language architectures, CI, testing, obscure languages, static verification, and type systems.

It has served Racket well, but the implementation is complex and difficult to explain in full, and it’s starting to fray around the edges with the addition of submodules. The new macro expander starts over using a new way of representing and tracking bindings. The resulting model of macro expansion is simpler and more uniform than the current one based on renaming, but it’s mostly compatible with the old expander.</p><p><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt</a> is a professor at the University of Utah and one of the main developers of Racket.

In the early days of GIMP, the designers added a scripting language, Script-Fu, based on Scheme.  Over the years, Script-Fu has been superseded by Python-Fu, although Script-Fu remains an option, albeit with a primitive IDE.  Over the past few years, my students and I have built a library that allows programmers to script GIMP using Racket and the DrRacket IDE.  In addition to providing the “glue” between GIMP and Racket, we also added a library of routines more amenable to novice programmers.  In this talk, we will discuss the design of both the “glue” and the broader library.  We will also discuss a related introductory course in CS that uses multiple models of image making as the motivating problem domain.</p><p><a href="http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/">Samuel A. Rebelsky</a> is Professor and Chair of Computer Science at Grinnell College, a small liberal arts college in the middle of Iowa. Although he teaches courses at every level of the curriculum, Sam is particularly passionate about teaching at the introductory level, where he has developed a workshop-style curriculum that combines image making and functional programming in Racket. Sam’s research projects have included Web tools, software for functional image making, and a system for combining imperative and lazy functional languages.</p></div><div class="subhead foldable"><a href="javascript:toggle_div('g187')"><div class="speaker"><span class="speaker-name" decode="exclude"><span class="time"></span> Vishesh Yadav</span><span class="title">The Big Bang Universe on the World Wide Web</span></div></a></div><div style="display:none;" id="g187" class="payload"><p>Each semester, thousands of students learn how to design programs using Racket’s “universe” library, a no-boilerplate framework for easily writing interactive graphical programs.
