</div></div><h3><span id="venue">27 Sept 2015 at the St. Louis Union Station hotel (the day after <a href="http://thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop</a>)</span></h3><p>RacketCon is a public meeting for everyone interested in Racket: developers, contributors, programmers, educators, and bystanders. It’s an opportunity for all members of the community to come together to share plans, ideas, and enthusiasm. RacketCon will enable the entire Racket community to mingle: to update each other, to exchange ideas, to collaborate, and to help shape the future of Racket.</p><h3><span id="stream">Videos</span></h3><p>Talk recordings are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr4KViVC0qJAsNuDeQzhFDjMK1gEdls8">here</a>.<br/>Links to individual talks below, with talk descriptions.</p><p>Live stream archive:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxz_6ZiCNgk">Morning sessions.</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PALBHyARNWo">Afternoon sessions.</a></p><h3><span id="speakers">Keynote speaker</span></h3><div class="subhead foldable"><a href="javascript:toggle_div('g1915')"><div class="keynote-speaker"><span class="speaker-name" decode="exclude"><span class="time"></span> Matthias Felleisen</span><span class="title">The Racket Manifesto</span></div></a></div><div style="display:none;" id="g1915" class="payload"><p><a href="2015/felleisen.pdf">Slides</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnczIyPXGfc&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLXr4KViVC0qJAsNuDeQzhFDjMK1gEdls8">Video</a></p><p>The creation of a programming language calls for guiding principles that point its developers to goals. This talk will spell out the three basic principles behind the 20-year development of Racket. First, programming is about stating and solving problems, and this activity normally takes place in a context with its own language of discourse; good programmers ought to formulate this language as a programming language. Hence, Racket is a programming language for creating new programming languages. Second, by following this language-oriented approach to programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of interconnected components. Each language and component must be able to protect its specific invariants. In support, Racket offers protection mechanisms to implement a full language spectrum, from C-level bit manipulation to soundly typed extensions. Third, because Racket considers programming as problem solving in the correct language, Racket also turns extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs, especially mechanisms for managing resources and projects. This talk will explain these principles and how Racket lives up to them, present the evaluation framework behind the design process, and conclude with a sketch of Racket’s imperfections and opportunities for future improvements.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias">Matthias Felleisen</a> is the Chief Philosopher and Shepherd (CPS) of PLT Design, Inc.

Currently, there are no good JIT compilers for the Scheme family of languages, despite their successful application to other dynamic languages.  In this talk, I will present Pycket; an implementation of Racket in RPython which makes use of the meta-tracing JIT infrastructure developed for the PyPy project.  The goal of Pycket is to provide a fast Racket implementation which can eliminate the overhead of features which are difficult to optimize statically such as gradual typing, continuations, and contracts.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://github.com/sabauma">Spenser Bauman</a> is a Ph.D. student at Indiana University where he studies programming language theory and implementation with Sam Tobin-Hochstadt and Jeremy Siek.

Match expanders, for example, allows users to extend Racket’s pattern matcher with arbitrary new patterns. This talk discusses a generalized approach to match-expanders and its uses in defining macros with embedded user-extensible syntax, and shows an application of this approach to Racket’s command line parsing forms.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://codepen.io/Universalist/">Jack Firth</a> works at Mindjet in San Francisco as a developer of enterprise web applications and as a mentor to his colleagues on functional programming, particularly its applications to a Node / Angular stack.

It has served Racket well, but the implementation is complex and difficult to explain in full, and it’s starting to fray around the edges with the addition of submodules. The new macro expander starts over using a new way of representing and tracking bindings. The resulting model of macro expansion is simpler and more uniform than the current one based on renaming, but it’s mostly compatible with the old expander.</p><div class="bio"><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt</a> is a professor at the University of Utah and one of the main developers of Racket.

Racket programmers may reach for linked lists when better structures would do to avoid the list-ref/vector-ref/stream-ref function zoo. This talk discusses the implementation of a generic collections system that encourages immutability by default, provides a more consistent and comprehensive interface across all data structures, and provides that interface in a way that can be leveraged by new, user-defined structures to feel as integrated with the language as Racket’s built-ins.</p><div class="bio"><a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/">Alexis King</a> works as a full-stack web developer at Philosophie in Los Angeles building rich web applications with Ruby on Rails and Angular. When not tinkering with different models to create expressive RESTful APIs, she is enthusiastic about finding ways to build programming interfaces that are expressive and easy to use.

Over the years, Script-Fu has been superseded by Python-Fu, although Script-Fu remains an option, albeit with a primitive IDE.  Over the past few years, my students and I have built a library that allows programmers to script GIMP using Racket and the DrRacket IDE.  In addition to providing the “glue” between GIMP and Racket, we also added a library of routines more amenable to novice programmers.  In this talk, we will discuss the design of both the “glue” and the broader library.
