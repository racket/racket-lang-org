◊h3{◊xtarget["overview"]{Overview}}

◊link["http://racket-lang.org/" ◊img[#:style "float:left;width:5rem;padding-right:0.5rem" #:src "http://racket-lang.org/img/racket-logo.svg"]] The ◊link["http://racket-lang.org/"]{Racket} The Racket team has spent over thirty years developing and refining language-oriented programming (LOP), an approach to software development through the lenses of programming languages and especially the use of domain-specifici languages (DSLs).  Racket School will introduce you to Racket’s framework for language-oriented programming, as spelled out in this recent ◊link[cacm]{cover article in the ◊strong{Communications of the ACM}}. 

This year, Racket School is divided into two tracks, using two different pedagogical approaches. 

For the first time, Racket School will be immediately followed by ◊link["https://con.racket-lang.org"]{RacketCon}, the annual Racket conference, on July 13 & 14. ◊strong{All Racket School tickets include admission to RacketCon.} We hope you'll stay for both events!



◊h3{◊xtarget["htdl"]{Track 1: How to Design Languages}}

A five-day class that will run July 8–12 (Monday–Friday). 

This track will be taught by ◊link["http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/"]{Matthias Felleisen}, ◊link["https://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/"]{Robby Findler}, ◊link["http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/"]{Matthew Flatt}, and ◊link["https://jeapostrophe.github.io/home/"]{Jay McCarthy}.

◊em{This track will cover:}

◊ul[

◊li{the spectrum of DSLs within a programming language;}

◊li{the Racket tools for creating DSLs;}

◊li{the process of creating these various DSLs with Racket;}

◊li{a meta-DSL for creating typed embedded DSLs;}

◊li{the research challenges in language-oriented programming.}

]

◊em{This track is good for:}

◊ul[

◊li{academic researchers at all levels who wish to understand LOP research,}

◊li{professionals who wish to learn in depth how to rapidly build DSLs,} 

◊li{students who wish to explore a potential area of research for a PhD, and}

◊li{faculty at all levels who wish to explore an approach to teaching LOP.}

]


◊em{Prerequisites:}

◊ul[

◊li{Course-based or self-directed Racket programming experience beyond ◊link["https://htpd.org/"]{How to Design Programs} and ◊link["http://realmofracket.com"]{Realm of Racket} is needed.} 

]


◊h3{◊xtarget["brw"]{Track 2: Beautiful Racket Workshop}}

A three-day class that will run July 10–12 (Wednesday–Friday).

This track will be taught by ◊link["https://beautifulracket.com/about-the-author.html"]{Matthew Butterick}, author of ◊link["https://beautifulracket.com/"]{Beautiful Racket} and ◊link["https://pollenpub.com/"]{Pollen}.


◊em{This track will cover:}

◊ul[

◊li{How to make programming languages in Racket, starting from the techniques described in ◊link["https://beautifulracket.com/"]{Beautiful Racket}.}

◊li{Racket's tools for language-oriented programming, including the macro system, libraries, and the DrRacket IDE.}

]

◊em{This track is good for:}

◊ul[

◊li{Those new to language-oriented programming generally or Racket in particular.}

◊li{Those who have already worked through ◊link["https://beautifulracket.com/"]{Beautiful Racket} and want more practice.}

◊li{Working programmers looking for practical techniques.}

◊li{Academic researchers outside of computer science.}

]

◊em{Prerequisites:}

◊ul[

◊li{Some programming experience: you've moved beyond beginner level in at least one modern programming language.}

◊li{No Racket experience required.}

◊li{No computer-science training required.}

◊h3{◊xtarget{Location}}

Racket School 2019 happpens at the ◊link[uutah]{University of Utah}. The University is located in lovely ◊link[slc]{Salt Lake City}, Utah, USA.

Utah is home to several US National Parks, Monuments, and Sites, the Sundance Film Festival, the Bonneville Salt Flats, and much more. Learn more ◊link[gov]{here}, ◊link[com]{here}, or ◊link[visit]{here}. 

The summer school will be held at the ◊link["https://goo.gl/maps/bpWGz93472s"]{Warnock Engineering Building (WEB)}. To get to campus, one option is ◊link["https://www.rideuta.com/Services/TRAX"]{TRAX light rail} to either the ◊link["https://goo.gl/maps/xQuXUA2ovtP2"]{Medical Center}, Fort Douglas, or Stadium stop. Walk to WEB from there, or a ◊link["http://www.uofubus.com/"]{free campus shuttle} stops at TRAX stations and near WEB.

◊h3{◊xtarget["schedule"]{Schedule}}

Each teaching day will run roughly ◊strong{9am to 5pm},  divided into four sections of about 75 min each. Some sections will be organized as traditional ◊strong{lectures}. In ◊strong{lab sessions}, the summer school participants will practice the lecture material with hands-on exercises; teaching assistants will be on hand to assist. Participants will also have time to consult with the faculty and teaching assistants on their own language projects. 

See the ◊link["https://school.racket-lang.org/2019/plan/"]{detailed schedule here}.
