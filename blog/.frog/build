This week, I started using a little helper macro, which wasn&rsquo;t in the core utils, to make some of my testing easier. I mentioned it to the super-friendly Racket community, they told me they liked it, and my pull request was merged within about 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Racket for a while, so I knew roughly where to lookto put my code, tests, and documentation.

I wanted to write some test cases for our</p>\n\n<p>parser, which generates things like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">parse</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"o.x\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-block</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n         <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-dot</span>\n                <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-id</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">o</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>A ton of detail is in the output keeping track of line number information.

The easiest way to contribute is to <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\">fork it</a>, and then check out your own copy. The check-out and build process is fairly standard; you should, however, make a directory called <code>build/</code> to hold the binaries that will be created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git clone git://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/racket.git\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>racket/src\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>mkdir build\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>build\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>../configure\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>make\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>make install\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This takes about 20&ndash;30 minutes, and installs all the necessary Racket binaries locally in place (no <code>sudo</code> or anything needed).</p>\n\n<p>Next up was to find RackUnit and the code I&rsquo;d need to extend.</p>\n\n<p>Most of what goes on in Racket&rsquo;s core utilities happens in <em>collections</em>, found in the <code>collects/</code> directory of the base directory of the checkout. For my implementation, I&rsquo;d be looking at <code>collects/rackunit</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I want to implement a new kind of <code>check</code>, so let&rsquo;s find that in RackUnit. Here&rsquo;s what the RackUnit directory looks like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/\ncompiled           gui.rkt   main.rkt  scribblings  tool.rkt\ndocs-complete.rkt  info.rkt  private   text-ui.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>private/</code> directory contains most of the internals of the built-in collections&rsquo; behavior, so let&rsquo;s look at that:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/private/\nbase.rkt        counter.rkt     location.rkt        <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-case.rkt\ncheck-info.rkt  format.rkt      monad.rkt           test.rkt\ncheck.rkt       gui             name-collector.rkt  <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-suite.rkt\ncompiled        <span class=\"nb\">hash</span>-monad.rkt  result.rkt          text-ui-util.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Well, <code>check.rkt</code> seems awfully promising.

There&rsquo;s actually a whole collection for tests in <code>collects/tests/</code>, which includes a rackunit subdirectory. Conveniently, this has been further divided into files that correspond to the files from the RackUnit collection itself:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/tests/rackunit/\nall-rackunit-tests.rkt  monad-test.rkt                \nbase-test.rkt           pr10950.rkt                   \ncheck-info-test.rkt     result-test.rkt               \ncheck-test.rkt          run-tests.rkt                 \ncounter-test.rkt        standalone-check-test.rkt     \nformat-test.rkt         standalone.rkt                \n<span class=\"nb\">hash</span>-monad-test.rkt     standalone-test-case-test.rkt\nlocation-test.rkt       <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-case-test.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>So, we can add a few expected uses to <code>check-test.rkt</code>, which will be tested against the implementation. I found the end of the check-tests, and inserted some simple test cases there, using the existing style of the file:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/stxcase-scheme..rkt)._......))\" style=\"color: inherit\">...</a></span>\n   <span class=\"c1\">;;

All that&rsquo;s left is to write something down about this feature that others will be able to find it and use it in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-documentation\">Adding Documentation</h2>\n\n<p>Racket uses a tool called <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html\">Scribble</a> for documentation, and by convention, a collection&rsquo;s documentation is stored in the <code>scribblings/</code> subdirectory of the collection:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/scribblings/\nacknowledgements.scrbl  control-flow.scrbl  philosophy.scrbl\napi.scrbl               file.rkt            quick-start.scrbl\nbase.rkt                file-test.rkt       rackunit.scrbl\ncheck.scrbl             internals.scrbl     release-notes.scrbl\ncompiled                misc.scrbl          ui.scrbl\ncompound-testing.scrbl  overview.scrbl      utils.scrbl\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Keeping with the theme, we&rsquo;ll be editing <code>check.scrbl</code> which is the file that&rsquo;s used to generate <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/api.html#(part._.Checks)\">this section</a> of the RackUnit documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Reading over the existing docs, I notice that our new feature is violating one of the principles of the existing documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Although checks are implemented as macros, which is necessary to grab source location, they are conceptually functions. This means, for instance, checks always evaluate their arguments.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07435.html\">Robby&rsquo;s recommendation</a> (the mailing list is helpful and responsive again!) I simply added a caveat \"(with the exception of @racket[check-match] below)\", and moved on to adding actual documentation for <code>check-match</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Scribble does two very cool things when documenting definitions. First, it has explicit syntax for telling the documentation system that you&rsquo;re introducing a new identifier that should be indexed and linkable. Second, it lets you write Racket code examples directly into the documentation, and even runs them and renders their results inline into the documenation.

This week, I started using a little helper macro, which wasn&rsquo;t in the core utils, to make some of my testing easier. I mentioned it to the super-friendly Racket community, they told me they liked it, and my pull request was merged within about 12 hours.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Racket for a while, so I knew roughly where to lookto put my code, tests, and documentation. A newer user might not know,so this post outlines, in some detail, the steps I went through to puttogether a tiny feature extension for Racket.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"a-tiny-feature\">A Tiny Feature</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m dabbling in the implementation of a <a href=\"http://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang\">small scripting language called Pyret</a> to study features of scripting objects. The language has a parser, which generates AST nodes. The nodes keep track of their location in the original program for error reporting, unbound identifier reporting, and the like. I wanted to write some test cases for our</p>\n\n<p>parser, which generates things like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">parse</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"o.x\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-block</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n         <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-dot</span>\n                <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s-id</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._srcloc))\" style=\"color: inherit\">srcloc</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"parse-tests.rkt\"</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span> <span class=\"no\">#f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">o</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n                <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">x</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>A ton of detail is in the output keeping track of line number information.

With a little help from <a href=\"http://www.jonahkagan.me/\">Jonah Kagan</a>, I produced a macro that does exactly that, and works nicely with <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/api.html\">RackUnit</a>, Racket&rsquo;s unit-testing framework (<a href=\"https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/blob/master/src/tests/parse-tests.rkt#L36\">see it in action</a>, with a slightly different name).</p>\n\n<p>I thought <code>check-match</code> was pretty useful, and figured I&rsquo;d see if the Racket folks at large would agree. I <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07427.html\">wrote a message</a> to the Racket mailing list, figuring someone might think it was neat. There was some <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07429.html\">immediate</a> <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07430.html\">positive</a> <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07428.html\">feedback</a>, so I decided to go ahead and try to add it.</p>\n\n<p>Getting and Extending Racket &mdash;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://github.com/plt/racket\">Racket&rsquo;s repo</a> is hosted on Github. The easiest way to contribute is to <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\">fork it</a>, and then check out your own copy. The check-out and build process is fairly standard; you should, however, make a directory called <code>build/</code> to hold the binaries that will be created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git clone git://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/racket.git\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>racket/src\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>mkdir build\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>build\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>../configure\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>make\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>make install\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This takes about 20&ndash;30 minutes, and installs all the necessary Racket binaries locally in place (no <code>sudo</code> or anything needed).</p>\n\n<p>Next up was to find RackUnit and the code I&rsquo;d need to extend.</p>\n\n<p>Most of what goes on in Racket&rsquo;s core utilities happens in <em>collections</em>, found in the <code>collects/</code> directory of the base directory of the checkout. For my implementation, I&rsquo;d be looking at <code>collects/rackunit</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I want to implement a new kind of <code>check</code>, so let&rsquo;s find that in RackUnit. Here&rsquo;s what the RackUnit directory looks like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/\ncompiled           gui.rkt   main.rkt  scribblings  tool.rkt\ndocs-complete.rkt  info.rkt  private   text-ui.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>private/</code> directory contains most of the internals of the built-in collections&rsquo; behavior, so let&rsquo;s look at that:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/private/\nbase.rkt        counter.rkt     location.rkt        <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-case.rkt\ncheck-info.rkt  format.rkt      monad.rkt           test.rkt\ncheck.rkt       gui             name-collector.rkt  <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-suite.rkt\ncompiled        <span class=\"nb\">hash</span>-monad.rkt  result.rkt          text-ui-util.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Well, <code>check.rkt</code> seems awfully promising. It defines all of the checks that you can see in the RackUnit docs:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._provide))\" style=\"color: inherit\">provide</a></span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/stxcase-scheme..rkt)._......))\" style=\"color: inherit\">...</a></span>\n         <span class=\"n\">check-eq?</span>\n         <span class=\"n\">check-eqv?</span>\n         <span class=\"n\">check-equal?</span>\n         <span class=\"n\">check-=</span>\n         <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/stxcase-scheme..rkt)._......))\" style=\"color: inherit\">...</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">define-binary-check</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">check-eq?</span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._eq~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">eq?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">define-binary-check</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">check-eqv?</span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._eqv~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">eqv?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">define-binary-check</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">check-equal?</span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/booleans.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._equal~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">equal?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">define-simple-check</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">check-=</span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span> <span class=\"n\">epsilon</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._magnitude))\" style=\"color: inherit\">magnitude</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._-))\" style=\"color: inherit\">-</a></span> <span class=\"n\">expr1</span> <span class=\"n\">expr2</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"n\">epsilon</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/stxcase-scheme..rkt)._......))\" style=\"color: inherit\">...</a></span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But before I go sticking my code in there willy-nilly, it&rsquo;s important to realize there are three things that need to go with a commit like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Tests</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Implementation</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Documentation</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll build up our commit in those stages.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-tests\">Adding Tests</h2>\n\n<p>First, I need to know how I&rsquo;m going to test this to make sure I don&rsquo;t screw anything up with my edits. There&rsquo;s actually a whole collection for tests in <code>collects/tests/</code>, which includes a rackunit subdirectory. Conveniently, this has been further divided into files that correspond to the files from the RackUnit collection itself:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/tests/rackunit/\nall-rackunit-tests.rkt  monad-test.rkt                \nbase-test.rkt           pr10950.rkt                   \ncheck-info-test.rkt     result-test.rkt               \ncheck-test.rkt          run-tests.rkt                 \ncounter-test.rkt        standalone-check-test.rkt     \nformat-test.rkt         standalone.rkt                \n<span class=\"nb\">hash</span>-monad-test.rkt     standalone-test-case-test.rkt\nlocation-test.rkt       <span class=\"nb\">test</span>-case-test.rkt\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>So, we can add a few expected uses to <code>check-test.rkt</code>, which will be tested against the implementation.

To run a particular test suite, Racket provides a tool called <code>raco</code> that was built by the <code>make install</code> above. To run our tests, we do (from the base <code>racket/</code> directory):</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>./bin/raco <span class=\"nb\">test </span>collects/tests/rackunit\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I iterated through this a few times to suss out all the minor bugs in what I&rsquo;d written. I also wanted to check that my tests were actually adding to the count, so I compared to the version without my changes by doing:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git stash\n<span class=\"c\"># stores my edits temporarily in git&#39;s stash</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>./bin/raco <span class=\"nb\">test </span>collects/tests/rackunit\n<span class=\"c\"># Output including \"120 tests passed, 0 tests failed\"</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>git stash apply\n<span class=\"c\"># re-applies my edits</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">$ </span>./bin/raco <span class=\"nb\">test </span>collects/tests/rackunit\n<span class=\"c\"># Output including \"127 tests passed, 0 tests failed\", which seems good,</span>\n<span class=\"c\"># since I wrote 7 new tests</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>So, I&rsquo;m happy with my implementation. All that&rsquo;s left is to write something down about this feature that others will be able to find it and use it in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-documentation\">Adding Documentation</h2>\n\n<p>Racket uses a tool called <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html\">Scribble</a> for documentation, and by convention, a collection&rsquo;s documentation is stored in the <code>scribblings/</code> subdirectory of the collection:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nv\">$ </span>ls collects/rackunit/scribblings/\nacknowledgements.scrbl  control-flow.scrbl  philosophy.scrbl\napi.scrbl               file.rkt            quick-start.scrbl\nbase.rkt                file-test.rkt       rackunit.scrbl\ncheck.scrbl             internals.scrbl     release-notes.scrbl\ncompiled                misc.scrbl          ui.scrbl\ncompound-testing.scrbl  overview.scrbl      utils.scrbl\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Keeping with the theme, we&rsquo;ll be editing <code>check.scrbl</code> which is the file that&rsquo;s used to generate <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/api.html#(part._.Checks)\">this section</a> of the RackUnit documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Reading over the existing docs, I notice that our new feature is violating one of the principles of the existing documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Although checks are implemented as macros, which is necessary to grab source location, they are conceptually functions. This means, for instance, checks always evaluate their arguments.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@racket-lang.org/msg07435.html\">Robby&rsquo;s recommendation</a> (the mailing list is helpful and responsive again!) I simply added a caveat \"(with the exception of @racket[check-match] below)\", and moved on to adding actual documentation for <code>check-match</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Scribble does two very cool things when documenting definitions. First, it has explicit syntax for telling the documentation system that you&rsquo;re introducing a new identifier that should be indexed and linkable. Second, it lets you write Racket code examples directly into the documentation, and even runs them and renders their results inline into the documenation.

"\n<p><em>posted by Matthew Flatt</em></p>\n\n<p>The <code>eval</code> function is at the heart of a dynamic language, and it strikes many newcomers as an amazingly powerful tool. At the same time, experienced programmers avoid <code>eval</code>, because unnecessary use creates trouble. It&rsquo;s not easy to explain why <code>eval</code> should be avoided or when it\"s appropriate to use <code>eval</code>, but I&rsquo;ll take another stab at it here.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-eval\">What is <code>eval</code>?</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the following &ldquo;program&rdquo; in English prose:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Assume that your favorite color is red. Now imagine a balloon that is  your favorite color. Paint a canvas the same color as the balloon.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>As English goes, that&rsquo;s a fairly clear program with a fairly well-defined result. When I follow those instructions, at least, I will always produce a red canvas (assuming that I have a canvas and some red paint, but a potential lack of art supplies is not the point here).</p>\n\n<p>I would come up with a red canvas even if I read the instructions when surrounded by people who speak only Chinese, obviously, since I&rsquo;m the one reading the instructions. Furthermore, it would be straightforward to translate the program to Chinese, and then a person who reads Chinese would produce a red canvas.</p>\n\n<p>A translator might even take the liberty of simplifying the program to just</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Paint a canvas red.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The translation loses some of the poetry of the original, but the result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>In Racket terms, the paragraph corresponds to a module. It can be compiled (i.e., translated) and optimized (i.e., simplified). A program can be made up of multiple modules that are written in different languages, but since each module can be reliably translated, they can all be compiled into some common language to run the program.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a different program:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Tell the person next to you &ldquo;Assume that your favorite color is red.&rdquo; Tell the person &ldquo;Now, imagine a balloon that is your favorite color.&rdquo; Tell the person &ldquo;Paint canvas the same color as the balloon.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting a red canvas back may be a little trickier in this case. If the person next to me speaks only Chinese, then my program may fail with a message-not-understood error.</p>\n\n<p>If I want to translate the program to Chinese, then it&rsquo;s not clear whether the parts in quotes should be translated. Maybe I mean for a person who can read Chinese but only sound out English to run the program when surrounded by English speakers, or maybe I mean for a Chinese person to run the program when surrounded by Chinese people. Either way, I have to be a lot more specific to a translator. For more complex programs, the instructions to the translator can become complex and fragile.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a translator probably won&rsquo;t feel comfortable simplifying the program to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Tell the person next to you &ldquo;Paint a canvas red.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>because there could be all sorts of environmental conditions that make the result different&mdash;such as people who are willing to paint but unwilling to accept assumptions about their favorite colors.</p>\n\n<p>The paragraph with &ldquo;tell the person&hellip;&rdquo; is a program that uses <code>eval</code>. It can&rsquo;t be compiled and optimized as well as the earlier paragraph, and the language context in which it is run may change the result. The quotes around sentences correspond to the quote in front of an expression passed to <code>eval</code> in Racket; there&rsquo;s no particular reason that the language for <code>eval</code> will match the language of the program that has the quoted text. The issues become even more complex if you try to implement different parts of the program in different languages.</p>\n\n<p>If the analogy to multiple spoken languages seems strange&mdash;maybe your language is Javascript, period&mdash;the problem of translation to another language is really a proxy for program understanding. There&rsquo;s a direct connection to performance and optimization (i.e., translation to efficient machine code), but using <code>eval</code> also makes a program more difficult to understand for the same reasons that it makes the program more difficult to translate. For example, a reader of your program may not be able to tell whether &ldquo;assume your favorite color is red&rdquo; is just a rhetorical device to get to a red canvas or whether some new instructions will arrive that will ask for your favorite color.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-is-eval-good\">When is <code>eval</code> Good?</h2>\n\n<p>The program with &ldquo;tell the person next to you&rdquo; above uses <code>eval</code> in a bad way. The task could just as well be performed by the person reading the instructions, instead of getting another nearby person involved.</p>\n\n<p>Some other uses <code>eval</code> are both good and necessary. For example, consider the following program:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Ask the construction manager for instructions. Walk to the building  site and convey those instructions to the construction crew.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This program uses <code>eval</code> when it conveys instructions to the construction crew, but no quoted forms appear in the program. The absence of quoted code is one sign that <code>eval</code> may be appropriate. Note that the program could work no matter what language the manager and crew speak, although there is an implicit (and sometimes non-trivial) assumption that the manager and crew speak the same language.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Go outside, and tell each member of the construction crew &ldquo;take a  lunch break, now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a quoted program in this case, but it&rsquo;s crucial to ask other people to run the quoted program, instead of just taking the lunch break yourself. That is, <code>eval</code> is really necessary. The implementor of this program takes on the burden of making sure that the instructions are in a suitable language, however, and may need to parameterize the quoted program by an explicit action to translate it to a language understood by the construction crew.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one more reasonable example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Ask the construction manager for instructions. Follow them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s the construction manager&rsquo;s problem to give you instructions in a language that you understand.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a questionable example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Decide how long to work before lunch, say N hours, and write a note  to yourself to work N hours. Add to the note by telling yourself to  take a lunch break afterward.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If you could really write that program without quotes, then it&rsquo;s probably ok. The example is misleading, though, because languages don&rsquo;t usually support</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>write a note to yourself to work N hours</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;d have to write instead</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>write a note to yourself that says &ldquo;work&rdquo; followed by the number N  and then &ldquo;hours&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>and the quote marks are where the problem comes in. If you translate the program to Chinese, then you have to be careful to somehow translate &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;hours&rdquo; to Chinese, too.</p>\n\n<p>The point here is not that programs without quoted text are clearly good or that programs with quoted text are clearly bad. The real point is that a programmer has to be especially careful about passing around instructions and using quoted instructions.

In Racket specifically, it means knowing the namespace toolbox and being as explicit as possible about the intended context for dynamic evaluation.</p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Matthew Flatt</em></p>\n\n<p>The <code>eval</code> function is at the heart of a dynamic language, and it strikes many newcomers as an amazingly powerful tool. At the same time, experienced programmers avoid <code>eval</code>, because unnecessary use creates trouble. It&rsquo;s not easy to explain why <code>eval</code> should be avoided or when it\"s appropriate to use <code>eval</code>, but I&rsquo;ll take another stab at it here.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-eval\">What is <code>eval</code>?</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the following &ldquo;program&rdquo; in English prose:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Assume that your favorite color is red. Now imagine a balloon that is  your favorite color. Paint a canvas the same color as the balloon.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>As English goes, that&rsquo;s a fairly clear program with a fairly well-defined result. When I follow those instructions, at least, I will always produce a red canvas (assuming that I have a canvas and some red paint, but a potential lack of art supplies is not the point here).</p>\n\n<p>I would come up with a red canvas even if I read the instructions when surrounded by people who speak only Chinese, obviously, since I&rsquo;m the one reading the instructions. Furthermore, it would be straightforward to translate the program to Chinese, and then a person who reads Chinese would produce a red canvas.</p>\n\n<p>A translator might even take the liberty of simplifying the program to just</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Paint a canvas red.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The translation loses some of the poetry of the original, but the result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>In Racket terms, the paragraph corresponds to a module. It can be compiled (i.e., translated) and optimized (i.e., simplified). A program can be made up of multiple modules that are written in different languages, but since each module can be reliably translated, they can all be compiled into some common language to run the program.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a different program:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Tell the person next to you &ldquo;Assume that your favorite color is red.&rdquo; Tell the person &ldquo;Now, imagine a balloon that is your favorite color.&rdquo; Tell the person &ldquo;Paint canvas the same color as the balloon.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting a red canvas back may be a little trickier in this case. If the person next to me speaks only Chinese, then my program may fail with a message-not-understood error.</p>\n\n<p>If I want to translate the program to Chinese, then it&rsquo;s not clear whether the parts in quotes should be translated. Maybe I mean for a person who can read Chinese but only sound out English to run the program when surrounded by English speakers, or maybe I mean for a Chinese person to run the program when surrounded by Chinese people. Either way, I have to be a lot more specific to a translator. For more complex programs, the instructions to the translator can become complex and fragile.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a translator probably won&rsquo;t feel comfortable simplifying the program to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Tell the person next to you &ldquo;Paint a canvas red.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>because there could be all sorts of environmental conditions that make the result different&mdash;such as people who are willing to paint but unwilling to accept assumptions about their favorite colors.</p>\n\n<p>The paragraph with &ldquo;tell the person&hellip;&rdquo; is a program that uses <code>eval</code>. It can&rsquo;t be compiled and optimized as well as the earlier paragraph, and the language context in which it is run may change the result. The quotes around sentences correspond to the quote in front of an expression passed to <code>eval</code> in Racket; there&rsquo;s no particular reason that the language for <code>eval</code> will match the language of the program that has the quoted text. The issues become even more complex if you try to implement different parts of the program in different languages.</p>\n\n<p>If the analogy to multiple spoken languages seems strange&mdash;maybe your language is Javascript, period&mdash;the problem of translation to another language is really a proxy for program understanding. There&rsquo;s a direct connection to performance and optimization (i.e., translation to efficient machine code), but using <code>eval</code> also makes a program more difficult to understand for the same reasons that it makes the program more difficult to translate. For example, a reader of your program may not be able to tell whether &ldquo;assume your favorite color is red&rdquo; is just a rhetorical device to get to a red canvas or whether some new instructions will arrive that will ask for your favorite color.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-is-eval-good\">When is <code>eval</code> Good?</h2>\n\n<p>The program with &ldquo;tell the person next to you&rdquo; above uses <code>eval</code> in a bad way. The task could just as well be performed by the person reading the instructions, instead of getting another nearby person involved.</p>\n\n<p>Some other uses <code>eval</code> are both good and necessary. For example, consider the following program:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Ask the construction manager for instructions. Walk to the building  site and convey those instructions to the construction crew.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This program uses <code>eval</code> when it conveys instructions to the construction crew, but no quoted forms appear in the program. The absence of quoted code is one sign that <code>eval</code> may be appropriate. Note that the program could work no matter what language the manager and crew speak, although there is an implicit (and sometimes non-trivial) assumption that the manager and crew speak the same language.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Go outside, and tell each member of the construction crew &ldquo;take a  lunch break, now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a quoted program in this case, but it&rsquo;s crucial to ask other people to run the quoted program, instead of just taking the lunch break yourself. That is, <code>eval</code> is really necessary. The implementor of this program takes on the burden of making sure that the instructions are in a suitable language, however, and may need to parameterize the quoted program by an explicit action to translate it to a language understood by the construction crew.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one more reasonable example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Ask the construction manager for instructions. Follow them.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s the construction manager&rsquo;s problem to give you instructions in a language that you understand.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a questionable example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Decide how long to work before lunch, say N hours, and write a note  to yourself to work N hours. Add to the note by telling yourself to  take a lunch break afterward.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>If you could really write that program without quotes, then it&rsquo;s probably ok. The example is misleading, though, because languages don&rsquo;t usually support</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>write a note to yourself to work N hours</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;d have to write instead</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>write a note to yourself that says &ldquo;work&rdquo; followed by the number N  and then &ldquo;hours&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>and the quote marks are where the problem comes in. If you translate the program to Chinese, then you have to be careful to somehow translate &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;hours&rdquo; to Chinese, too.</p>\n\n<p>The point here is not that programs without quoted text are clearly good or that programs with quoted text are clearly bad. The real point is that a programmer has to be especially careful about passing around instructions and using quoted instructions. Using <code>eval</code> means accepting the burden of using instructions will make sense by the time they are delivered. That burdened is best avoided, which is why experienced programmers avoid <code>eval</code>, but some of the examples illustrate cases where the burden is not avoidable or where the actions enabled by <code>eval</code> make the burden worthwhile.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-eval-in-racket\">Using <code>eval</code> in Racket</h2>\n\n<p>In the context of Racket, the multiple-language analogy is relatively accurate, because Racket is about having many programming languages work together and allowing programmers to define ever better languages and language constructs.

"\n<p><em>posted by Robby Findler</em></p>\n\n<p>One of the many changes in v4.0 is to close a security hole in DrScheme. Specifically, DrScheme v371 lets the program in the definitions window get a hold of the editor containing said program and manipulate it programmatically. There are lots of bad things one might do with this fact, like circumventing DrScheme&rsquo;s protections and cause it to crash, or even spontaneously exit.</p>\n\n<p>But, we can do something even more fun. Put the following program into a DrScheme window (in v371) and set the language to the mzscheme/textual language. Change &ldquo;input&rdquo; to whatever number you wish to compute the factorial of and then hit the Run button until your program transforms itself into the final result.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush:

"\n<p><em>posted by Noel</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium/\">Selenium</a> is a tool for testing web applications, the core of which is a Javascript library that controls a web browser. With the <a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/\">Selenium IDE</a> you can convert your actions in a web browser into tests, and with the <a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/\">Selenium Remote Control</a> you can control a web browser from code. I&rsquo;ve recently been working on adding Selenium Remote Control bindings to PLT Scheme, which has resulted in a nice and hopefully instructional demonstration of XML transformation in PLT Scheme</p>\n\n<p>The Selenium Remote Control is controlled by sending simple messages over HTTP. The format of the messages isn&rsquo;t important. What is, is that there are a lot of them, and the API is specified in a file called <code>iedoc.xml</code> that comes with Selenium. The Java/Python/Ruby bindings are generated using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/\">XSL</a>. If I was to use XSL I&rsquo;d have a processing pipeline that uses three languages (XSL, Java, Scheme) which is two more than I&rsquo;d like. Hence I turned to <a href=\"http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=webit.plt&amp;owner=jim\">WebIt!</a>, an XML transformation DSL written in Scheme, to create an all Scheme pipeline. The rest of this post wshows the steps I used to transform the Selenium API into Scheme code using WebIt! I think this is interesting in its own right, but also serves as a nice demonstration of the power of macros, which WebIt! makes extensive use of.</p>\n\n<p>My first step is to get an idea of the structure of the XML.

This is as far as I want to go in this article. We&rsquo;ve seen how we can use SSAX. SXPath, and WebIt! to create XML transforms in pure Scheme. There is a lot more to all of these packages but what we&rsquo;ve used is sufficient for many uses. The rest of the code to create Scheme from the API is quite straightforward and specific to Selenium. If you&rsquo;re curious read the source of the Selenium PLaneT package, which will be released soon.</p>\n\n<p><em>This post also appears on <a href=\"http://www.untyped.com/untyping\">Untyping</a></em></p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Noel</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium/\">Selenium</a> is a tool for testing web applications, the core of which is a Javascript library that controls a web browser. With the <a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium-ide/\">Selenium IDE</a> you can convert your actions in a web browser into tests, and with the <a href=\"http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/\">Selenium Remote Control</a> you can control a web browser from code. I&rsquo;ve recently been working on adding Selenium Remote Control bindings to PLT Scheme, which has resulted in a nice and hopefully instructional demonstration of XML transformation in PLT Scheme</p>\n\n<p>The Selenium Remote Control is controlled by sending simple messages over HTTP. The format of the messages isn&rsquo;t important. What is, is that there are a lot of them, and the API is specified in a file called <code>iedoc.xml</code> that comes with Selenium. The Java/Python/Ruby bindings are generated using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/\">XSL</a>. If I was to use XSL I&rsquo;d have a processing pipeline that uses three languages (XSL, Java, Scheme) which is two more than I&rsquo;d like. Hence I turned to <a href=\"http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=webit.plt&amp;owner=jim\">WebIt!</a>, an XML transformation DSL written in Scheme, to create an all Scheme pipeline. The rest of this post wshows the steps I used to transform the Selenium API into Scheme code using WebIt! I think this is interesting in its own right, but also serves as a nice demonstration of the power of macros, which WebIt! makes extensive use of.</p>\n\n<p>My first step is to get an idea of the structure of the XML. The bits I&rsquo;m interested in look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: html\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nt\">&lt;function</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"click\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;param</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"locator\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>an element locator<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/param&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;comment&gt;</span>Clicks on a link, button, checkbox or radio button.\n  If the click action causes a new page to load (like a link usually\n  does), call waitForPageToLoad.<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/comment&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/function&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s read in the XML file and extract all the <code>function</code> elements.

Then follows zero or more <code>param</code> elements, with attribute <code>name</code>, the value of which is bound to <code>param-name</code>. Finally we expect a <code>comment</code> element which can contain any amount of data. The use of <code>_</code> as the binding name is a common convention to indicate data we don&rsquo;t care about but must still match to make our pattern complete.</p>\n\n<p>I run the code in DrScheme and see the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"n\">_xml-match:</span> <span class=\"n\">no</span> <span class=\"n\">matching</span> <span class=\"n\">clause</span> <span class=\"n\">found_</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Oops.

However we can easily fix this by adding a catch all pattern that raises an error telling us what we failed to match. The code follows.

This is as far as I want to go in this article. We&rsquo;ve seen how we can use SSAX. SXPath, and WebIt! to create XML transforms in pure Scheme.

Windows and Mac OS X users will see smaller changes, such as better printing, better handling of mouse-wheel events, and support for 64-bit Windows and Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>On the inside, version 5.1 is the biggest single change in Racket (or PLT Scheme) history. We’ve reimplemented the GUI layer, which meant throwing out about 200,000 lines of C++ code that built on Xt, Win32, and Carbon. We’ve replaced that C++ code with about 30,000 lines of Racket code that builds on Gtk, Win32, Cocoa, Cairo, and Pango. This change modernizes Racket&rsquo;s graphics support while significantly reducing the cost of maintaining the GUI and drawing libraries.</p>\n\n<p>In the space between the GUI implementation and the surface, there are many API improvements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>You can run GUI programs with just <code>racket</code>, instead of having to use <code>gracket</code>. Depending on how much your platform distinguishes between GUI and console applications, there may still be an advantage to using <code>gracket</code> (i.e., to tell the OS that you mean to start a GUI application or that you want a single instance of the application), but the difference is minor.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Most of the drawing library has moved to <code>racket/draw</code>, which you can use without the rest of the GUI library – and, in the case of Unix platforms, without an X-server connection. After detangling the graphics and GUIs libraries, the graphics library is now integrated in more places, such as adding pict support for Scribble documents.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The drawing library includes some new capabilities, such as rotation, affine transformations, and bitmaps with alpha channels.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>Replacing hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ code with tens of thousands of lines of Racket code sounds like a no-brainer. The old library was implemented in C++ because we started in 1995 by gluing together a Scheme interpreter with a portable GUI library. Then the GUI code stayed in C++, because the interpreter wasn’t fast enough and the foreign interface was too clumsy. Racket is now plenty fast and its foreign interface has improved a lot since then.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the reimplementation took about 18 months. Smoothly integrating cross-platform GUI support with a programming language can be more difficult than it sounds, and mating new libraries with a legacy API creates additional challenges. Finally, many Racket tools depend Racket’s “eventspaces,” which are multiple process-like entities in the same virtual machine, each with its own GUI event loop. Implementing eventspaces on top of modern GUI toolkits turns out to be tricky, because the toolkits insist on a single event-loop per process and they cannot tolerate event-loop actions during certain callbacks. Fortunately, delimited continuations can help work around those limitations.</p>\n\n<p>Cairo and Pango are the two big enablers of the Racket graphics rewrite. The old Racket graphics library depended on many toolkits (X11, Win32, QuickDraw, Quartz, PostScript, and more), and it had poor font handling. Again, the problem was that we chose the previous technology in 1995. Cairo and Pango have since solved the portable-graphics problem, and we were able to trade in 80,000 lines of C++ glue for about 8,000 lines of Racket glue. The code could be much less if we didn’t have to match most of the old drawing API, but we&rsquo;re still very happy with the result.</p>\n\n<p>On the GUI side, the remaining 22,000 lines of Racket code replace similar C++ code that binds to three different toolkits. The set of underlying toolkits has changed, and a few eventspace tricks are new, but the approach is essentially the same as before. The code is nevertheless much more compact, because (no surprise) Racket is better than C++. Interestingly, the amount of toolkit-specific code is right around 6,500 lines for each toolkit, even though the way that a C programmer uses the different toolkits seems very different: Objective-C classes (Cocoa) versus signal callbacks with explicit wiring (Gtk) versus a single callback function for message handling (Win32). Maybe they&rsquo;re the same because we built a Racket mini-language for each toolkit that makes them all about equally convenient.</p>\n\n<p>The rewrite is not perfectly compatible with old code, and no doubt we have many bugs to find before the release. The process is well on track, though, and the new library implementations give a us a solid foundation to keep making Racket better.</p>\n\n<p>To try out the current development version, visit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers\">http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers</a></p>") #t (u .

Fortunately, delimited continuations can help work around those limitations.</p>\n\n<p>Cairo and Pango are the two big enablers of the Racket graphics rewrite. The old Racket graphics library depended on many toolkits (X11, Win32, QuickDraw, Quartz, PostScript, and more), and it had poor font handling. Again, the problem was that we chose the previous technology in 1995. Cairo and Pango have since solved the portable-graphics problem, and we were able to trade in 80,000 lines of C++ glue for about 8,000 lines of Racket glue. The code could be much less if we didn’t have to match most of the old drawing API, but we&rsquo;re still very happy with the result.</p>\n\n<p>On the GUI side, the remaining 22,000 lines of Racket code replace similar C++ code that binds to three different toolkits. The set of underlying toolkits has changed, and a few eventspace tricks are new, but the approach is essentially the same as before. The code is nevertheless much more compact, because (no surprise) Racket is better than C++. Interestingly, the amount of toolkit-specific code is right around 6,500 lines for each toolkit, even though the way that a C programmer uses the different toolkits seems very different: Objective-C classes (Cocoa) versus signal callbacks with explicit wiring (Gtk) versus a single callback function for message handling (Win32). Maybe they&rsquo;re the same because we built a Racket mini-language for each toolkit that makes them all about equally convenient.</p>\n\n<p>The rewrite is not perfectly compatible with old code, and no doubt we have many bugs to find before the release. The process is well on track, though, and the new library implementations give a us a solid foundation to keep making Racket better.</p>\n\n<p>To try out the current development version, visit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers\">http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers</a></p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>This is fantastic!

It turns out that this bug has been fixed, but machine-configuration issues have prevented a new build from completing since Sunday. We&rsquo;ll get a working Windows build up soon.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 8 December 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>How did &ldquo;delimited continuations [] help work around those limitations&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>grant rettke, 8 December 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>When you said that event loop were insisting on there only being one per process, were you thinking of GTK or only Mac/Win? AFAIK you can have multiple glib event loops without issue. You typically have one per thread, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as one per process.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>joseph, 9 December 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Delimited continuations help when a particular callback must be executed before further events are handled. For example, while you drag a scroll thumb on some platforms, the toolbox is in charge of the event loop; if handling a scroll-changed event calls code that takes forever, then the whole GUI system becomes stuck. Delimited continuations let Racket call arbitrary code to handle the scroll event, and if it doesn&rsquo;t complete fast enough, a continuation is captured and resumed sometime later, allowing the GUI to partially respond meanwhile. This use of delimited continuations is similar to a use to implement threads, but without facets of threads (such as thread-specific data) that would get in the way.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 9 December 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>On one event loop per process: I was thinking of Cocoa and Gtk. Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong about Gtk. I know that glib supports multiple event loops, but my impression was that the generality isn&rsquo;t preserved through the Gtk layer. I couldn&rsquo;t get multiple event loops to work in Gtk, and I got the impression from the docs and web searches that it couldn&rsquo;t work, but I&rsquo;d welcome a pointer to a little example showing a program with multiple Gtk event loops.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 9 December 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Great!

So I put #!r6rs in the definitions area (above the repl). Then followed it by a factorial function. It doesn&rsquo;t complain about the #!r6rs anymore, but now it complains about &ldquo;expected an import declaration&rdquo;. If I choose Pretty Big or R5RS, everything is hunky doory. Why can&rsquo;t there just be a R6RS mode?</p>\n\n<p>I guess I better read up on this &lsquo;module&rsquo; language. I really just wanted to try this out. I must be missing something.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eric, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Isn&rsquo;t your question about r6rs rather than module?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>matthias, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>All I want is to start up PLT Scheme and be able to write code which conforms to R6RS. Nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eric, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Code that conforms to R6RS starts with <code>(import ...)' at a minimum. Your other alternative is to start with</code>(library &hellip; (export &hellip;) (import &hellip;) &hellip;)&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>To run R6RS programs/libraries in DrScheme, you also have to start with `#!r6rs&rsquo;, even though R6RS itself doesn&rsquo;t require that. Yes, in the Module language. Experience so far has convinced us that it&rsquo;s better to declare a program&rsquo;s language in the source, instead of having a zillion language choices in a GUI dialog; that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve avoided adding an &ldquo;R6RS&rdquo; option in DrScheme&rsquo;s langauge dialog (and why we&rsquo;ve removed several PLT-specific options at the same time).</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, maybe you can help us improve the documentation. Using the online docs, I would have guessed that you&rsquo;d go to http://docs.plt-scheme.org/, follow the &ldquo;R6RS&rdquo; link, and then read the first chapter on running R6RS programs.

Can you tell us more about the path you took and how it failed you?\"</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>There was no real method to my madness. I fired up PLT Scheme. I saw no language was selected. I haven&rsquo;t used scheme in a long time, but when I did I would usually just select R5RS or Pretty Big and then just start coding. So, I thought I would go and do the same thing, except now that R6RS is implemented, I might was well switch to that by default. So I went to select a language. I didn&rsquo;t see R6RS. So I read all the descriptions of the others, none of which really means anything to me. The small blurb at the bottom doesn&rsquo;t really say enough to convey the differences. All I knew is that I wanted R6RS. I couldn&rsquo;t find it or make heads or tails of any of it, so I decided to go to plt-scheme website and look at docs. On the docs page I did a search for &lsquo;language&rsquo;. As I was looking for documentation on the differences of the particular languages. I saw the R6RS link but I thought that was a spec, or description of the language itself. I was just interested in how to get the language setup so I could work in PLT Scheme. (ie. I was viewing that as the first step before I would read in detail about R6RS). So failing to find anything there, my next step was to google it, which of course comes up with overwhelming results which I scanned a few and then stopped and asked on this blog. And so here we stand.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I was just looking for a quick canvas to &lsquo;go&rsquo;. I just wanted to try it, I didn&rsquo;t really want to think about it. (never had to before, so maybe thats why)</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eric, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>What about having an R6RS option and just dumping the \"#!r6rs (import (rnrs)) ;put code here\" directly into the definition pane when its selected. You could even follow it with a modal window explaining that with r6rs, you must precede all files with this syntax blah blah and have a &ldquo;do not show again&rdquo; checkbox. Even have a link to the online documentation for more details. I would have figured that out pretty quick :).</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eric, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting idea. It sounds similar to the way that Visual Studio or XCode will create a project based on a template &mdash; except that instead of a pile of project settings, DrScheme would just give you a few starting lines of text.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 12 June 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Horay! Thanks so much to everyone working on PLT Scheme.

A Racket extension programmer can thus add constructs that are indistinguishable from “native” notation, large and complex embedded domain-specific languages, and even optimizing transformations for the compiler backend. This power to experiment with language design has been used to create a series of sub-languages for programming with first-class classes and modules, numerous languages for implementing the Racket system, and the creation of a complete and fully integrated typed sister language to Racket&rsquo;s untyped base language.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>This paper explains Racket&rsquo;s language extension API via an implementation of a small typed sister language. The new language provides a rich type system that accommodates the idioms of untyped Racket. Furthermore, modules in this typed language can safely exchange values with untyped modules. Last but not least, the implementation includes a type-based optimizer that achieves promising speedups.

A client computes a request, transmits and halts, waiting for a server response. On receipt, the server computes a response, transmits and halts, waiting for the next client request. This much is well known. Racket&rsquo;s magnificent <em>stateful</em> Web server does three things on the server side:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>it reifies a Racket continuation, capturing where the server computation has halted.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>it externalizes the continuation, creating a URL-representation that uniquely maps to the Racket continuation</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>it disseminates the externalized continuation to interested clients, typically via HTTP response, but alternately via SMTP or any other protocol. Then, it waits. Later, when presented with an externalized continuation, a quick inverse mapping occurs, the underlying Racket continuation is invoked, and the server processes the new client request. Rinse and repeat. The problem with this approach is twofold</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>the reified Racket continuations live in server memory. And there&rsquo;s no safe way to garbage collect, as the continuations could be invoked at any time. There are strategies to reclaim memory, but <em>some</em> load level will noticeably decrease the performance of your application. And its not possible to figure out what that load level is prior to finishing your application.

"\n<p><em>posted by Jay McCarthy</em></p>\n\n<p>Communication using HTTP between client and server is a simple problem of halted computation. A client computes a request, transmits and halts, waiting for a server response. On receipt, the server computes a response, transmits and halts, waiting for the next client request. This much is well known. Racket&rsquo;s magnificent <em>stateful</em> Web server does three things on the server side:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>it reifies a Racket continuation, capturing where the server computation has halted.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>it externalizes the continuation, creating a URL-representation that uniquely maps to the Racket continuation</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>it disseminates the externalized continuation to interested clients, typically via HTTP response, but alternately via SMTP or any other protocol. Then, it waits. Later, when presented with an externalized continuation, a quick inverse mapping occurs, the underlying Racket continuation is invoked, and the server processes the new client request. Rinse and repeat. The problem with this approach is twofold</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>the reified Racket continuations live in server memory. And there&rsquo;s no safe way to garbage collect, as the continuations could be invoked at any time. There are strategies to reclaim memory, but <em>some</em> load level will noticeably decrease the performance of your application. And its not possible to figure out what that load level is prior to finishing your application. This is a problem.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Again, the reified Racket continuations live in server memory and cannot be moved. So there&rsquo;s no way to scale an application to more than one server.

Arguably, when some other Schemer provides a non-functional <code>f</code>, then it’s their problem; they have to deal with the consequences (which may well be minor compared to some benefits of using mutation).</p>\n\n<p>The <code>map</code> function might also receive a non-list, but the <code>map</code> implementor can guard against such misuse of <code>map</code> by wrapping it with a check,</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">checked-map</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._if))\" style=\"color: inherit\">if</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/map..rkt)._map))\" style=\"color: inherit\">map</a></span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._error))\" style=\"color: inherit\">error</a></span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/map..rkt)._map))\" style=\"color: inherit\">map</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"not a list\"</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>and then exporting <code>checked-map</code> instead of the raw <code>map</code>.

Moreover, it uses mutation in a particularly unfortunate way: the <code>list?</code> test in <code>checked-map</code> succeeds, because the argument is initially a list, and the mutation is ultimately discovered by a call to <code>cdr</code> &mdash; but only if checks haven&rsquo;t been disabled.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a Schemer, then unless you’ve seen this before, or unless you thought a bit about the title of this section, then you probably didn&rsquo;t think of the above test case for <code>map</code>. A Schemer’s view of lists is so deeply functional that it&rsquo;s hard to make this particular leap.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this example is not contrived. If you have either Chez Scheme version 6.1 or a pre&ndash;200 MzScheme sitting around, calling <code>map</code> as above leads to a seg fault or an invalid memory access:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  Chez Scheme Version 6.1\n  Copyright <span class=\"o\">(</span>c<span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"m\">1998</span> Cadence Research Systems\n\n  &gt; <span class=\"o\">(</span>define l <span class=\"o\">(</span>list <span class=\"m\">1</span> <span class=\"m\">2</span> <span class=\"m\">3</span> <span class=\"m\">4</span> 5<span class=\"o\">))</span>\n  &gt; <span class=\"o\">(</span>map <span class=\"o\">(</span>lambda <span class=\"o\">(</span>x<span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span>-cdr! <span class=\"o\">(</span>cddr l<span class=\"o\">)</span> 5<span class=\"o\">))</span> l<span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n  Error: invalid memory reference.\n  Some debugging context may have been lost.\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>map</code> example illustrates how mutable pairs can break a Schemer’s natural and ingrained model of programming. Of course, if optimizing and providing friendly error messages for <code>map</code> were the only issues with mutable pairs, then it wouldn’t matter; Scheme implementors are smart enough to (eventually) get this right. Unfortunately, the underlying problem is more pervasive.</p>\n\n<p>In the API for a typical Scheme library, lists can be used for many kinds of input and output. Flags for options might be provided in a list. A function might provide information about the current configuration (e.g., the current items in a GUI list box) in a list. Procedures or methods that deal gracefully with list mutation are few and far between. In most cases, the result of unexpected mutation is merely a bad error message; sometimes, however, unexpected mutation of a list can break the library’s internal invariants. In the worst case, the library whose internal invariants are broken plays some role in a system’s overall security.</p>\n\n<p>Mutable lists also interfere with the language’s extensibility. The PLT Scheme contract system, for example, offers a way to wrap an exported function with a contract that constrains its input and outputs, which are optionally (in principle) enforced by run-time checks. Higher-order contracts, such as “a list of functions that consume and produce numbers”, require wrappers on sub-pieces, and these wrappers can be installed only by copying the enclosing list. Copying a mutable list changes the semantics of a program, however, whereas contracts are supposed to enforce invariants without otherwise changing the program. Copying an immutable list creates no such problem.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, mutable lists make the language’s specification messy. The R6RS editors spent considerable energy trying to pin down the exception-raising guarantees of <code>map</code>; the possibility of mutable pairs made it difficult to provide much of a guarantee. The standard says that implementations should check that the lists provided to<code>map</code> are the same length, but it’s not worth much to require that check, since an argument’s length as a list can change via mutation to the list’s pairs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switching-to-immutable-pairs\">Switching to Immutable Pairs</h2>\n\n<p>The designers of PLT Scheme long ago recognized the problems of mutable pairs, and we introduced functions like <code>cons-immutable</code> and<code>list-immutable</code> to support programming with immutable lists. These additions solved some problems &mdash; but only in the cases where we were careful to use immutable lists. The R6RS editors also recognized the problems of mutable pairs, so that <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr!</code> were banished to their own library &mdash; but programmers are still free to use that library.</p>\n\n<p>While these are worthwhile steps for many reasons, they do not solve the underlying problem. Library implementors who deal in lists must still either set up elaborate guards against mutation, pretend that the problem doesn&rsquo;t matter, or require the use of a special immutable-list datatype that is incompatible with libraries whose authors set up elaborate guards or ignore the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Why all this hassle? If most Scheme code really does use and expect pairs in a functional way, can&rsquo;t we just switch to immutable pair? Most Scheme code will still work, untold security holes will have been closed, specifications will become instantly tighter, and language extensions like contracts will work better.</p>\n\n<p>Schemers have been reluctant to make this leap, because it has never been clear just how much code relies on mutable pairs. We don’t know how much the switch will cost in porting time and long-term incompatibility, and we don’t really know how much we will gain. We won&rsquo;t know until we try it.</p>\n\n<p>For PLT Scheme v4.0, we’re going to try it. In our main dialects of Scheme (such as the <code>mzscheme</code> language), <code>cons</code> will create immutable pairs, and <code>pair?</code> and <code>list?</code> will recognize only immutable pairs and lists. The <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr</code> procedures will not exist. A new set of procedure <code>mcons</code>, <code>mcar</code>, <code>mcdr</code>, <code>set-mcar!</code>, and <code>set-mcdr!</code> will support mutable pairs. (A related v4.0 change is that <code>define-struct</code> by default creates immutable structure types.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, PLT Scheme v4.0 will support an R5RS language where <code>cons</code> is <code>mcons</code>, and so on, so many old programs can still run easily in the new version. The difference is that interoperability between R5RS libraries and PLT Scheme libraries will be less direct than before.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"experience-so-far\">Experience So Far</h2>\n\n<p>PLT Scheme v3.99.0.2 exists already in a branch of our SVN repository, and it will soon move to the SVN trunk. That is, we have already ported at least a half million lines of Scheme code to a dialect without <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr!</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion took about eight hours. Obviously, relatively little code had to change. The following are the typical porting scenarios:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>The <code>reverse!</code> and <code>append!</code> functions were frequently used for “linear updates” by performance-conscious implementors. As our underlying Scheme implementation has improved, however, the performance benefits of these functions has become less. All uses could be replaced with <code>reverse</code> and <code>append</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The <code>set-cdr!</code> operation was often used to implement an internal queue.

Moreover, it uses mutation in a particularly unfortunate way: the <code>list?</code> test in <code>checked-map</code> succeeds, because the argument is initially a list, and the mutation is ultimately discovered by a call to <code>cdr</code> &mdash; but only if checks haven&rsquo;t been disabled.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a Schemer, then unless you’ve seen this before, or unless you thought a bit about the title of this section, then you probably didn&rsquo;t think of the above test case for <code>map</code>. A Schemer’s view of lists is so deeply functional that it&rsquo;s hard to make this particular leap.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this example is not contrived. If you have either Chez Scheme version 6.1 or a pre&ndash;200 MzScheme sitting around, calling <code>map</code> as above leads to a seg fault or an invalid memory access:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: bash\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  Chez Scheme Version 6.1\n  Copyright <span class=\"o\">(</span>c<span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"m\">1998</span> Cadence Research Systems\n\n  &gt; <span class=\"o\">(</span>define l <span class=\"o\">(</span>list <span class=\"m\">1</span> <span class=\"m\">2</span> <span class=\"m\">3</span> <span class=\"m\">4</span> 5<span class=\"o\">))</span>\n  &gt; <span class=\"o\">(</span>map <span class=\"o\">(</span>lambda <span class=\"o\">(</span>x<span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span>-cdr! <span class=\"o\">(</span>cddr l<span class=\"o\">)</span> 5<span class=\"o\">))</span> l<span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n  Error: invalid memory reference.\n  Some debugging context may have been lost.\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The <code>map</code> example illustrates how mutable pairs can break a Schemer’s natural and ingrained model of programming. Of course, if optimizing and providing friendly error messages for <code>map</code> were the only issues with mutable pairs, then it wouldn’t matter; Scheme implementors are smart enough to (eventually) get this right. Unfortunately, the underlying problem is more pervasive.</p>\n\n<p>In the API for a typical Scheme library, lists can be used for many kinds of input and output. Flags for options might be provided in a list. A function might provide information about the current configuration (e.g., the current items in a GUI list box) in a list. Procedures or methods that deal gracefully with list mutation are few and far between. In most cases, the result of unexpected mutation is merely a bad error message; sometimes, however, unexpected mutation of a list can break the library’s internal invariants. In the worst case, the library whose internal invariants are broken plays some role in a system’s overall security.</p>\n\n<p>Mutable lists also interfere with the language’s extensibility. The PLT Scheme contract system, for example, offers a way to wrap an exported function with a contract that constrains its input and outputs, which are optionally (in principle) enforced by run-time checks. Higher-order contracts, such as “a list of functions that consume and produce numbers”, require wrappers on sub-pieces, and these wrappers can be installed only by copying the enclosing list. Copying a mutable list changes the semantics of a program, however, whereas contracts are supposed to enforce invariants without otherwise changing the program. Copying an immutable list creates no such problem.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, mutable lists make the language’s specification messy. The R6RS editors spent considerable energy trying to pin down the exception-raising guarantees of <code>map</code>; the possibility of mutable pairs made it difficult to provide much of a guarantee. The standard says that implementations should check that the lists provided to<code>map</code> are the same length, but it’s not worth much to require that check, since an argument’s length as a list can change via mutation to the list’s pairs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"switching-to-immutable-pairs\">Switching to Immutable Pairs</h2>\n\n<p>The designers of PLT Scheme long ago recognized the problems of mutable pairs, and we introduced functions like <code>cons-immutable</code> and<code>list-immutable</code> to support programming with immutable lists. These additions solved some problems &mdash; but only in the cases where we were careful to use immutable lists. The R6RS editors also recognized the problems of mutable pairs, so that <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr!</code> were banished to their own library &mdash; but programmers are still free to use that library.</p>\n\n<p>While these are worthwhile steps for many reasons, they do not solve the underlying problem. Library implementors who deal in lists must still either set up elaborate guards against mutation, pretend that the problem doesn&rsquo;t matter, or require the use of a special immutable-list datatype that is incompatible with libraries whose authors set up elaborate guards or ignore the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Why all this hassle? If most Scheme code really does use and expect pairs in a functional way, can&rsquo;t we just switch to immutable pair? Most Scheme code will still work, untold security holes will have been closed, specifications will become instantly tighter, and language extensions like contracts will work better.</p>\n\n<p>Schemers have been reluctant to make this leap, because it has never been clear just how much code relies on mutable pairs. We don’t know how much the switch will cost in porting time and long-term incompatibility, and we don’t really know how much we will gain. We won&rsquo;t know until we try it.</p>\n\n<p>For PLT Scheme v4.0, we’re going to try it. In our main dialects of Scheme (such as the <code>mzscheme</code> language), <code>cons</code> will create immutable pairs, and <code>pair?</code> and <code>list?</code> will recognize only immutable pairs and lists. The <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr</code> procedures will not exist. A new set of procedure <code>mcons</code>, <code>mcar</code>, <code>mcdr</code>, <code>set-mcar!</code>, and <code>set-mcdr!</code> will support mutable pairs. (A related v4.0 change is that <code>define-struct</code> by default creates immutable structure types.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, PLT Scheme v4.0 will support an R5RS language where <code>cons</code> is <code>mcons</code>, and so on, so many old programs can still run easily in the new version. The difference is that interoperability between R5RS libraries and PLT Scheme libraries will be less direct than before.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"experience-so-far\">Experience So Far</h2>\n\n<p>PLT Scheme v3.99.0.2 exists already in a branch of our SVN repository, and it will soon move to the SVN trunk. That is, we have already ported at least a half million lines of Scheme code to a dialect without <code>set-car!</code> and <code>set-cdr!</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion took about eight hours. Obviously, relatively little code had to change. The following are the typical porting scenarios:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>The <code>reverse!</code> and <code>append!</code> functions were frequently used for “linear updates” by performance-conscious implementors. As our underlying Scheme implementation has improved, however, the performance benefits of these functions has become less.

I think the former is much more troublesome than the latter. Did you consider semi-mutable pairs, that is, pairs whose car is mutable but cdr is immutable? In the code you have converted, is set-cdr! more common than set-car!?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Alan Watson, 12 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><code>set-car!</code> doesn&rsquo;t merely prevent copying (which is a big enough problem for the contract system); it can also break invariants, as in the example of reflecting a list-box&rsquo;s content.</p>\n\n<p>So, keeping <code>set-car!</code> leaves us with problems. Would keeping it solve any problems in practice? I did indeed see <code>set-cdr!</code> more than <code>set-car!</code>, and I can&rsquo;t think of an example that would have run if only we had kept <code>set-car!</code>. Thus, aside from tradition, I don&rsquo;t yet see any rationale for keeping <code>set-car!</code> &mdash; but I&rsquo;m eager to hear about other experience.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 12 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The only situations where I find myself mutating pairs are, on first glance, generating lists front to back, which you discussed, using pairs to implement simple &lsquo;pairs of values&rsquo;, where structs/objects/vectors could be used instead, and for sorted insertion into lists, which is more fundamental, but I guess would be a good place to use mutable pairs.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Marijn, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Perhaps all I am saying is that the arguments against set-car! are the standard arguments against mutation, whereas the arguments against set-cdr! are those plus the problems it creates for procedures like map. Thus, the justification for eliminating set-car! is similar to the justification for making records immutable (as you have done), whereas the justification for eliminating set-cdr! is this and more.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Alan Watson, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Alan: I think that the arguments against set-cdr! are in fact the same arguments against any old mutation (ie, just like the anti-set-car! arguments). Even tho the core libraries of Scheme (things like map) suffer more due to set-cdr!, ordinary programs suffer equally in our experience (as Matthew has explained).</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, let me encourage you to put your theory to the test and find some non-trivial programs or libraries that back up your point!</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robby, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>My point is not that there are libraries or programs in which set-car! is a good idea. My point is an opinion, perhaps badly expressed, on why each creates problems and which is worse. Sorry for the noise.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Alan Watson, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I tend to agree. I do use set-car! and set-cdr! time to time, but mostly from my laziness to use more appropriate data structures instead. Recently I also started to avoid the use of set-cdr! to create list from front to back, for it doesn&rsquo;t work well with call/cc.</p>\n\n<p>However, there&rsquo;s one more area that I see the mutable pairs are indispensable; circular lists. Though it has its own problems, it is sometimes very handy to express some kind of code concisely where I&rsquo;d use infinite lazy list in Haskell. It only needs mutation at construction time, and we can make it &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; so that it won&rsquo;t have the problem of &ldquo;the list changing during traversal&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have some plan to support circular structures specially (e.g. srfi&ndash;38 notation or srfi&ndash;1&rsquo;s circular-list procedure hides mutation &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; so that the users only see immutable, already constructed structures)?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shiro Kawai, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Yes. Version 3.99.0.2 has <code>make-reader-graph</code> for creating cycles built from immutable pairs. We need a better name, but the current name reflects that <code>read</code> still supports the #n= and #n# graph notation. (We&rsquo;ve dropped support for cyclic syntax objects, though, so <code>read-syntax</code> no longer supports the graph notation).</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 13 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been online now for over 30 minutes, and AFAIK, I haven&rsquo;t been hacked. This is a banner day. Hi Matt; great article! Out of necessity, from a security standpoint, I have converted all my boxes to some flavor of *nix. As soon as I can download 3.99, I&rsquo;ll try to reproduce the flavor of the data from my flatten benchmark article. This time it will be different, simply because they&rsquo;ll be on a new OS.

As I recall from my earlier results, the biggest difference advantage to using mutation came about when a poor algorithm had been choosen to begin with, that required the reversal of the result list. These quite substantially improved their performance with the use of reverse! However, the more elegant functional solutions, under favorable conditions, actually out performed even the fastest mutable algorithms. Not typically, but definitely always in the race. The success of building functional solutions, which are also efficient is certainly achieved with other functional languages. I&rsquo;ll have to redesign my queue routine, as you mentioned, but it will be worth the effort. I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting a copy on my box as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Take care.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash;kylr</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Kyle Smith, 18 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Did not observe any problem beyond the typical usages noted in the article when I moved SSAX and SXML to R6RS libraries.</p>\n\n<p>Typical use is in implementing &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; queues.

In PLT Redex, the stepper uses mutable lists to represent the currently visible portion of the reduction graph. When someone clicks the &ldquo;next&rdquo; button, it does a set-cdr! to add something to the end of that graph.</p>\n\n<p>The Mistake. When I converted the code to v4, I figured that I should preserve the mutation, so I went in and changed a few set-car!s to set-mcar!s and then changed about 15 or 20 uses of filter, for-each, ormap, list-ref, and friends to versions of those that worked on mutable pairs instead of immutable ones. This took about 2 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Not too bad, you might think. Two hours? Sometimes fixing one little bug can take longer than that, days even. Got away cheaply, you might think &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>What I Should Have Done. Today I decided that I wanted the code to work in both v4 and in earlier versions of PLT Scheme, since the code&rsquo;ll be on PLaneT, after all and not everyone is using v4 yet. Sigh. So now I need to go undo that work and copy the list instead of mutating its tail. So I did that.</p>\n\n<p>5 minutes. Done. Working code.</p>\n\n<p>10 more minutes: removing all of the now useless helper functions that dealt with the mutable-pair versions of filter, for-each, ormap, list-ref.</p>\n\n<p>Oh well. Lesson learned, I suppose.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robby, 27 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>On replacing set! with set-box!: in a sense, this is so easy that the compiler does it automatically. That is, mutable variables are already implemented via boxes. You always know statically whether a variable needs to be boxed and unboxed due to lexical scope plus rules on mutating module-defined identifiers. For essentially the same reason, <code>set!</code> doesn&rsquo;t really cause much trouble; programmers usually see <code>set!</code>s and know to treat the relevant variable with care &mdash; in contrast with <code>set-car!</code>s, which could be in a library that you don&rsquo;t see.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 27 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>We have so far not changed the interaction of <code>cons</code> with <code>eq?</code> or <code>eqv?</code>. Specifically, <code>cons</code>, <code>list</code>, etc. are guaranteed to create fresh cons cells, in the sense that <code>eq?</code> distinguishes them, even though the cons cells are immutable. I think we may want to remove this guarantee eventually, because it would make some constant-folding optimizations easier and enable hash-consing, but we&rsquo;ll take one step at a time.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 27 November 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A little late, but &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Once one acknowledges value of circular/recursive list data, it follows that there is likely value in the native runtime creation of such data as may be used for example to express arbitrarily recursively defined hierarchical information; which beyond the trivial, seems seems like a significant loss to the language to push such capability outside the baseline scope of the language by default.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, such capability may be defined and utilized as required although not as elegantly as if it were native; however it seems a shame to seriously consider alienating the previously native capability to dynamically formulate native list data from datum not known at program specification/compile time (i.e. the ability to formulate and manipulate such list datum from information extracted during run-time, as data bases typically are, can not be performed natively without set-car! set-cdr!, nor specified purely functionally); as the loss of such a potentially powerful and useful capability seems like a poor trade in exchange for the questionable value of default immutable lists, especially as the mutability of function argument can most typically be easily determined within a function, and optimizations applied accordingly, and in the few cases where it can&rsquo;t, so what, presume it may be mutated. (If the concern is limited to map, then simply specify that map&rsquo;s arguments are presumed to not be mutated until terminated, or generally forbidden).</p>\n\n<p>— <em>pschlie, 15 December 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The entire purpose of this experiment was to avoid caveats like &ldquo;seems&rdquo;, &ldquo;likely&rdquo; and &ldquo;potentially&rdquo;.

So far we have far better abstract arguments against mutation than for it, and no concrete experience suggesting it should be brought back.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I should remind you that mcons (and friends) exist, as do mutable structs.

Thereby I view dropping native mutable lists in an effort to improve determinism, in effect an attempt to improve a deficiency by removing utility; as opposed to improving its utility, by removing a deficiency.)</p>\n\n<p>Implying:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>a facility to create/manipulate such data at run-time is required.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>mcons (and friends) are only rudimentarily facilitates, which exclusively operate on a now severely crippled data type because mutable lists have been alienated from the language (incompatible with car and friends) and thereby incompatible with the majority of all native list functions and thereby now require an entirely redundant and largely absent collection of functions to specified to operate on and utilize them (inclusive of their inability to be evaluated as code):</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>a facility to store and retrieve such data at run-time is required.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>as there is no current reader support to denote mutable lists:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>(mcons &lsquo;a &rsquo;{b}) -&gt; {a .

(while were at it, maybe list data types and functions should be removed entirely, as after all, they&rsquo;re not strictly necessary as evidenced by most all other languages).</p>\n\n<p>In hind sight, justifying mutable list removal because large classes of programs do not require them, or that the language&rsquo;s specification may be easier in their absents, or because the contract facility implementation isn&rsquo;t capable determining if list data is in fact potentially mutated; hardly seems reasonable. IMHO</p>\n\n<p>— <em>pschlie, 16 December 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Paul, this is not what I meant by concrete. No one said (or attempted to prove) that mutable cons cells were useless. Indeed, we still support them, but we just do not use them by default anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The comment &ldquo;justifying mutable list removal because large classes of programs do not require them&rdquo; misses half of the problem with mutable lists. The first half of the problem, in fact. Matthew&rsquo;s post clearly explains why mutable lists cause problems in concrete ways and, if you permit me to say so, makes a far more convincing abstract case against mutable pairs than your abstract arguments for them.</p>\n\n<p>But, in any case, these abstract arguments (either way) ultimately need to be backed up with real programs. Let me encourage you once again to provide some to back up your arguments. We have found none in a large body of code. Have you investigated a body of code and found some?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robby, 16 December 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The problems you describe with mutability remind me of type-theory where each kind of thing is separated into its own type. Then you can always use the types in conjunction with each other if you need the functionality of both.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you had the types <code>list</code> and <code>mutable</code> you could distinguish between an immutable list of immutable elements, an immutable list of mutable elements, a mutable list of immutable elements, and so on, and put this in your &ldquo;contract system&rdquo; (whatever that is).</p>\n\n<p>This not only documents the usage of things like mutability, but also allows the compiler (in theory) to check such constraints on inputs and outputs.</p>\n\n<p>When a function like <code>map</code> expects an immutable list, it will simply use the <code>list</code> type without restricting the mutation of elements. But in places where that could be harmful, a different type can be used. The conventional Scheme way of allowing everything to be mutable prevents this separation of distinct properties of values.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not too familiar with how Scheme implements things, but the general way this is done is to box things that are mutable.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Jon T, 28 December 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In another five years or so you&rsquo;ll be where ML was twenty years ago!

Assoclists now have become immutable lists of mutable pairs with a hybrid-assq procedure added. The imperative queues remain mutable lists, the cdr of the last pair being the only one being updated. My code did not contain anything like append! or reverse!. I found no trouble in swithing to v3.99.0.9. I say yes to the better conditions for optimization.

But that&rsquo;s not going to do any good, so I&rsquo;ll stop replying. Feel free to continue on the PLT list, or email me.</p>\n\n<p>Michael: I&rsquo;m talking about several efforts that attempt to get the benefits of a dynamic language into a static language like ML. There was some work done on reflecting types (or reifying types) which makes it possible to sort of package a value together with a type object (in the run-time sense; it becomes a value). IIRC, there was also something related to universal types that goes in the same direction.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I found that MLers who blindly bash Scheme for it&rsquo;s lack of types are just as bad as Schemers who blindly bash all static typing. IMO (and in the opinion of many other good people I&rsquo;ve talked to) there are very good advantages on both sides &mdash; and the real challenge is to get dynamic languages like Scheme to benefit from the advantages of statically typed languages like ML, and vice versa. Some people choose to work on just that (from either side), some people don&rsquo;t but appreciate those who do, and some people will inevitably continue to spit out useless comments even in a completely unrelated context, like the above anonymous poster.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 26 January 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you just love it when language maintainers drop a feature because someone, somewhere, might misuse it?</p>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s next?

December 16, 2007 6:56 PM  &mdash;-End Quote&mdash;-</p>\n\n<p>Over 25 years ago, I used set-cdr! in a PC Scheme implementation of N-Queens for an AI class. Besides using set-cdr!, calls to move a queen were properly tail recursive. I noticed the PLT Scheme benchmark didn&rsquo;t use tail recursion for moves, so I modified my code to match the benchmark. The following times compare the improvements for just using set-cdr! and for using set-cdr! combined with tail recursion:</p>\n\n<p>PLT Scheme Benchmark: &gt; (begin (collect-garbage) (time (nqueens 15))) cpu time: 158899 real time: 158982 gc time: 16920 2279184 (execution time = cpu time - gc time = 142.0s)</p>\n\n<p>set-cdr! version: &gt; (begin (collect-garbage) (time (N-Queens 15))) cpu time: 138616 real time: 138787 gc time: 3286 2279184 (execution time = cpu time - gc time = 135.3s)</p>\n\n<p>set-cdr! plus properly tail recursive moves: &gt; (begin (collect-garbage) (time (N-Queens 15))) cpu time: 119845 real time: 120061 gc time: 3284 2279184 (execution time = cpu time - gc time = 116.5s)</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, using set-cdr! improved overall cpu time by about the same amount as using properly tail recursive moves. The major performance improvement for set-cdr! came from reduced garbage collection. N-Queens is just one example of back-tracking used to traverse a search space. Any time the search space can be pruned before the back-tracking call is made, and restored on return from the call, set-cdr! should yield improved performance. It&rsquo;s also very localized, as shown by the following code snippet:</p>\n\n<p>(else ..(set-mcdr! prior-column (mcdr column)) ..(begin0 &hellip;.(place&amp;move safe-columns &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..(mcdr safe-columns) safe-columns &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..(cons (mcar column) solution) count) &hellip;.(set-mcdr! prior-column column))))))</p>\n\n<p>In the above example, prior-column and column traverse the list, while safe-columns always points to it&rsquo;s beginning. The list is never copied, just manipulated with set-mcdr! as the search space is traversed. Also, the list goes from 0 to N to simplify handling prior-column.</p>\n\n<p>Gene Snider</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Gene Snider, 27 January 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Way to go PLT Scheme 4.x.

Typed Racket’s optimizer replaces <code>&lt;</code> with <code>unsafe-fl&lt;</code>. This tells the compiler that the elements are floats, so it can keep them stack-allocated, which reduces allocations further. In all, for my particular use of inline-sort, it’s over 50 times faster than sort.And using it is a heckuvalot easier than writing an if tree and reasoning about transitivity every time I need to sort a handful of floats.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p> Writing macros in expansion-time CPS to fully inline a recursive function works out beautifully. I suspect that it will work on any recursive, polymorphic function whose well-foundedness follows only from the structure of the input data.Also, it can generate a metric truckload of code.Interesting note: I originally wrote inline-sort using only syntax-rules, passing the names of higher-order macros to other macros as continuations. Sorting a five-element list took almost 19000 expansion steps, which is ridiculously inefficient even for a 120-leaf if tree.</p>") #t (u .

Typed Racket’s optimizer replaces <code>&lt;</code> with <code>unsafe-fl&lt;</code>. This tells the compiler that the elements are floats, so it can keep them stack-allocated, which reduces allocations further. In all, for my particular use of inline-sort, it’s over 50 times faster than sort.And using it is a heckuvalot easier than writing an if tree and reasoning about transitivity every time I need to sort a handful of floats.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p> Writing macros in expansion-time CPS to fully inline a recursive function works out beautifully. I suspect that it will work on any recursive, polymorphic function whose well-foundedness follows only from the structure of the input data.Also, it can generate a metric truckload of code.Interesting note: I originally wrote inline-sort using only syntax-rules, passing the names of higher-order macros to other macros as continuations.

How much more? Well, I ran a script that starts up DrRacket, opens class-internal.rkt from the distribution and puts the insertion point right before the first \" character. It then repeats these three steps 10 times: first it types fdjafjdklafjkdalsfjdaklfjdkaslfdjafjdklafjkdalsfjdaklfjdkasl as fast as it can, then it types the same number of backspaces. Next it type \"a and waits for the syntax colorer to finish adjusting the colors. Then it deletes those two (again with two backspaces) finally waits for background check syntax to complete.</p>\n\n<p>The script also measures the number of wall-clock milliseconds that the handling of each event took and here are the results:</p>\n\n<p>Each vertical bar’s hight is proportional to the percentage of the events that took at least the corresponding number of milliseconds. The red bars show how well version 5.3.1’s DrRacket does, and the blue shows how the current git head fares (as of <a href=\"http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/a4d440a5\">http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/a4d440a5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, about 80% of the events took less than 26 milliseconds to complete in the current version, but more like 60 milliseconds in 5.3.1. As some sense of scale, a television refreshes its screen every 16 2/3s millseconds, so if all of the events took less than that then DrRacket would feel very responsive indeed.</p>\n\n<p>How?:  The key to finding all of the performance improvements was finding something to measure.

"\n<p><em>posted by Robby Findler</em></p>\n\n<p>DrRacket is now more responsive when editing than the 5.3.1 release. How much more? Well, I ran a script that starts up DrRacket, opens class-internal.rkt from the distribution and puts the insertion point right before the first \" character. It then repeats these three steps 10 times: first it types fdjafjdklafjkdalsfjdaklfjdkaslfdjafjdklafjkdalsfjdaklfjdkasl as fast as it can, then it types the same number of backspaces. Next it type \"a and waits for the syntax colorer to finish adjusting the colors. Then it deletes those two (again with two backspaces) finally waits for background check syntax to complete.</p>\n\n<p>The script also measures the number of wall-clock milliseconds that the handling of each event took and here are the results:</p>\n\n<p>Each vertical bar’s hight is proportional to the percentage of the events that took at least the corresponding number of milliseconds. The red bars show how well version 5.3.1’s DrRacket does, and the blue shows how the current git head fares (as of <a href=\"http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/a4d440a5\">http://git.racket-lang.org/plt/commit/a4d440a5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, about 80% of the events took less than 26 milliseconds to complete in the current version, but more like 60 milliseconds in 5.3.1. As some sense of scale, a television refreshes its screen every 16 2/3s millseconds, so if all of the events took less than that then DrRacket would feel very responsive indeed.</p>\n\n<p>How?:  The key to finding all of the performance improvements was finding something to measure.

It is a useful &ldquo;Abmahnung&rdquo; (imperative is as close as I can get in English) for the designers of programming languages. Due to this imperative, Scheme is simpler than CL to this day and will remain so: one space for values; one powerful construction for control; etc. To this day, I consider Scheme the experimental &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; cousin of CL, and when Guy will write CLtL/3 one day, perhaps he and his colleagues will borrow from Scheme.</p>\n\n<p>Robert: &ldquo;son&rdquo; refers to an ICFP paper with the title &ldquo;revenge of the son of the LISP machine&rdquo; and &ldquo;You want it&rdquo; refers to an ICFP paper on modules and macros. Search on Matthew&rsquo;s page; he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have tags/labels available.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>matthias, 15 June 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I stick to my question: Doesn&rsquo;t this mean that Scheme has ultimately failed to adhere to the imperative it set for itself?</p>\n\n<p>As far as I see it, the major contribution of the original Scheme reports was to show that it is possible to define a substrate of the then common language constructs and programming paradigms. First-class continuations and tail recursion give you the means to implement any control abstractions (including advanced ones like backtracking and generators), lambda expressions give you the basic mechanisms to implement data structures (including advanced ones like Smalltalk-style objects). Indeed, Scheme removed &ldquo;the weaknesses and restrictions that make such additional features appear necessary&rdquo; at the end of the 70&rsquo;s / beginning of the 80&rsquo;s.</p>\n\n<p>By R6RS, Scheme will have seen the addition of, for example, hygienic macros, a module system, Unicode, bytevectors, and records. However, these features have just been added on top of the existing Scheme language. It&rsquo;s at least not obvious to me that attempts have been made to remove &ldquo;the weaknesses and restrictions that make such additional features appear necessary.&rdquo; To the contrary: Syntax-rules was adopted as a macro system, although Clinger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Macros that Work&rdquo; would have been a subset on top of which other hygienic macro systems could have been built. Syntax-case is now being adopted but doesn&rsquo;t replace syntax-rules, although it&rsquo;s the more general macro system. If anyone wanted to add, say, syntactic closures on top of R6RS, there is no machinery to do so (or it&rsquo;s at least not obvious how to do this). Next, there is no substrate for implementing module systems, for example, in order to experiment with alternative module systems. I don&rsquo;t know whether such a substrate would be possible, but this doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that &ldquo;just&rdquo; one of the possible design alternative is being adopted. Scheme doesn&rsquo;t seem to adopt a way to extend the kinds of character sets it can deal with. Instead, Unicode is being adopted, again without a substrate that could enable other kinds of character sets. Bytevectors are given a literal syntax, but there is no provision for programmatically extending surface syntax, although it is know how to do this in Lisp dialects. Records are provided with different APIs. Although there is a low-level functional API for dealing with records, again there is no substrate that would allow building other variations of records. For example, there is no way to add multiple inheritance to records or to change how record fields are represented, although again it is known how to achieve these things with appropriate substrates.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with you that the notion of a minimal language that provides enough rope to build everything else on top is essentially a pipe dream. But claiming that a particular language is closer to this ideal than others although it is objectively (!) as bloated as the next one is pretentious.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to your remarks about a hypothetical CLtL3: I am not worried about the prospect of feeding some of the experiences of building current Scheme systems back into Common Lisp. To the contrary, I actually think that a lot of interesting work has been done in the Scheme community, some of which surpasses what is possible in Common Lisp. However, I am worried about the fact that this doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen the other way around. Few Schemers seem to have a good working knowledge of Common Lisp, as you can tell for example by mischaracterizations of Common Lisp in papers about Scheme-related research. Those who do, usually assess Common Lisp in a much more humble way. (See http://community.schemewiki.org/?Scheme-VS-Common-Lisp for example.)</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that there is so little communication between the Scheme and the Common Lisp communities. We could learn a lot from each other, and it is important to realize that this holds for both directions. I am glad that Christian Queinnec, Manuel Serrano and especially Michael Sperber were present at this year&rsquo;s International Lisp Conference (mostly attended by Common Lispers), and hope that this has a positive effective in that regard in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Pascal Costanza, 16 June 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>&ldquo;Scheme is simpler than CL&rdquo; does not mean it is better than CL.

R6RS, as it is currently proposed, is simpler / more uniform in some respects, but more complex in others.

So Common Lisp is more uniform in that regard.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This is a general observation in programming language design, IMHO: If you simplify some aspects of a programming language, others will turn out more complex, and as soon as a programming language grows beyond a certain size, the best you can do is to try to balance the various trade offs. Unfortunately, the initial simplifications in the originally covered areas limit the kinds of decisions you can afford to make in other areas later on. This is a fate that a lot of programming languages have faced in the past and are still facing.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t try to say anything about &ldquo;better&rdquo; (and didn&rsquo;t intend to suggest that you do). &ldquo;Better&rdquo; is, of course, always relative to a particular task at hand.</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>This is good to hear. The mailing list archive is hard to navigate and it seems impossible to search in it. The load seems to be high, so I probably will not subscribe to it.

This gives you full flexibility of &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; keyword arguments while being able to preprocess them at compile time when concrete keyword arguments are statically known.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>It&rsquo;s good to hear that we agree on something. :)</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>— <em>Pascal Costanza, 16 June 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that there is so little communication between the Scheme and the Common Lisp communities.

At the meetup I gave a short demo about the upcoming support for classes and object-oriented programming in Typed Racket. In this blog post, I’ll go over the concepts I presented in my demo.</p>\n\n<p>Background</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As many readers already know, <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/ts-guide/index.html\">Typed Racket</a> is a gradually-typed sister language to Racket. That means it’s a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing#Static_type-checking\">statically-typed</a> language that accommodates the idioms of Racket. Programs written in Racket should seamlessly port to Typed Racket with the addition of type annotations here and there. You can even keep some parts of the program dynamically-typed and Typed Racket will make sure those parts won’t break the type invariants via <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/guide/contracts.html\">contracts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, supporting all Racket idioms is quite a lot of work, especially since it’s a constantly evolving language. One of the big pieces missing from Typed Racket right now is support for <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/guide/classes.html\">classes and objects</a>. Since the GUI library heavily uses the class system, it’s important to support the object-oriented subset of Racket.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting classes isn’t trivial though. There are a bunch of issues, but the main ones are: (1) the class system is built as a complex macro and so reconstructing the information needed to type-check is tricky, and (2) we need to make sure that interoperation between Racket and Typed Racket using classes/objects can be done safely.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t go over the technical details about the implementation in this blog post, but contact me if you’re interested. In the rest of the blog post, I’ll show some examples to demonstrate what programming in Typed Racket with classes looks like. Just so you know, these examples won’t work in the current version of Typed Racket but will be supported in a future release.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: If you like to live dangerously, you can track the experimental branch with support for classes <a href=\"https://github.com/takikawa/racket/tree/tr-classes\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fishes-and-types\">Fishes and types</h2>\n\n<p>To start out, let’s look at an untyped example from the Racket Guide on classes and objects.

"\n<p><em>posted by Asumu Takikawa</em></p>\n\n<p>Recently we had our inaugural <a href=\"https://dekvek.com/racket-salon/\">Racket Salon</a> meetup here in Boston, graciously organized by Dan King. At the meetup I gave a short demo about the upcoming support for classes and object-oriented programming in Typed Racket. In this blog post, I’ll go over the concepts I presented in my demo.</p>\n\n<p>Background</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As many readers already know, <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/ts-guide/index.html\">Typed Racket</a> is a gradually-typed sister language to Racket. That means it’s a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing#Static_type-checking\">statically-typed</a> language that accommodates the idioms of Racket. Programs written in Racket should seamlessly port to Typed Racket with the addition of type annotations here and there. You can even keep some parts of the program dynamically-typed and Typed Racket will make sure those parts won’t break the type invariants via <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/guide/contracts.html\">contracts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, supporting all Racket idioms is quite a lot of work, especially since it’s a constantly evolving language. One of the big pieces missing from Typed Racket right now is support for <a href=\"http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/guide/classes.html\">classes and objects</a>. Since the GUI library heavily uses the class system, it’s important to support the object-oriented subset of Racket.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting classes isn’t trivial though. There are a bunch of issues, but the main ones are: (1) the class system is built as a complex macro and so reconstructing the information needed to type-check is tricky, and (2) we need to make sure that interoperation between Racket and Typed Racket using classes/objects can be done safely.</p>\n\n<p>I won’t go over the technical details about the implementation in this blog post, but contact me if you’re interested. In the rest of the blog post, I’ll show some examples to demonstrate what programming in Typed Racket with classes looks like. Just so you know, these examples won’t work in the current version of Typed Racket but will be supported in a future release.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: If you like to live dangerously, you can track the experimental branch with support for classes <a href=\"https://github.com/takikawa/racket/tree/tr-classes\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fishes-and-types\">Fishes and types</h2>\n\n<p>To start out, let’s look at an untyped example from the Racket Guide on classes and objects. The following snippet defines a fish% class. The class has several features: an initialization argument named size, a private field named current-size, three methods get-size, grow, and eat.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">fish%</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._class))\" style=\"color: inherit\">class</a></span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._object~25))\" style=\"color: inherit\">object%</a></span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._init))\" style=\"color: inherit\">init</a></span> <span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">current-size</span> <span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._super-new))\" style=\"color: inherit\">super-new</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/public))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/public</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">get-size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">current-size</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/public))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/public</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">grow</span> <span class=\"n\">amt</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/set_.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._set!))\" style=\"color: inherit\">set!</a></span> <span class=\"n\">current-size</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span> <span class=\"n\">amt</span> <span class=\"n\">current-size</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createclass.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._define/public))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define/public</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">eat</span> <span class=\"n\">other-fish</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">grow</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/ivaraccess.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._send))\" style=\"color: inherit\">send</a></span> <span class=\"n\">other-fish</span> <span class=\"n\">get-size</span><span class=\"p\">)))))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The notation should seem mostly familiar if you’ve programmed in Java or other object-oriented languages. The % suffix is a convention for identifiers that are bound to class values. The object% value is the superclass of fish% and is the root class of all class hierarchies. The initialization argument size is used when constructing an instance of a class:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._new))\" style=\"color: inherit\">new</a></span> <span class=\"n\">fish%</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">size</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">object:fish%</span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stx-patterns.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/stxcase-scheme..rkt)._......))\" style=\"color: inherit\">...</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Note that in Racket, classes are just values that can be passed around like anything else.

That’s a topic for another blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: In other words, Racket has first-class classes.

The initial version was little more than glue code between a few open-source libraries, which seemed to offer the quickest solution to our modest goals. Modest success leads to bigger goals, however, and then continued success leads to ever more ambitious goals. Before you know it, a mass of users, co-developers, libraries, and documentation rely on design decisions that were made for a much smaller project years before.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, many of those early design decisions turn out to be a poor fit for the project&rsquo;s eventual role. Starting from scratch isn&rsquo;t usually practical, so you gradually adjust the infrastructure to meet new needs. That was precisely the story for the version 300 series of releases for PLT Scheme. The biggest gap between our original and current goals was in run-time performance, so we replaced bytecode interpretation with a just-in-time native-code compiler, and we replaced a memory manager based on &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; estimates of pointer usage with one that uses precise information.</p>\n\n<p>Performance improves a bit more with version 4.0, but mostly we&rsquo;ve moved on to a bigger mismatch between the original and current goals: the way that PLT Scheme presents itself to users. PLT Scheme was originally conceived as R5RS Scheme with some extensions to make it practical, and with useful tools (notably an IDE) and libraries (notably a GUI library) built on that core. Our documentation and web pages reflected that architecture - which now seems completely upside-down.</p>\n\n<p>Version 4.0 is a fresh start in the way that we present PLT Scheme. It&rsquo;s a new language. PLT Scheme is a dialect of Scheme, certainly, but it&rsquo;s not merely a superset of R5RS, R6RS, or other standards, and those standards are not really the best place to start understanding PLT Scheme. At the same time, the unique extensibility features of the PLT Scheme language and tools allow them to support other languages easily, including R5RS (though a new <code>plt-r5rs</code> executable), R6RS, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Improvements to the PLT Scheme language include better syntax for modules, better support for optional and keyword function arguments, more expressive syntax for structure types, streamlined hash-table operations, new syntax for list comprehensions and iterations, a more complete and consistent set of list and string operations, and reduced dependence on mutable pairs. To current users of PLT Scheme, these changes will seem like the big ones behind version 4.0, but they&rsquo;re small compared to the overall re-organization and the accompanying documentation effort.</p>\n\n<p>We wrote hundreds of pages of new documentation, including much more tutorial and overview information. We ported hundreds of pages of existing documents to new a system that produces cleaner, better organized, more consistent output. We will replace the old tangle of web pages (that try to explain a confusing federation of tools) with a simple page about &ldquo;PLT Scheme.&rdquo; We have even streamlined the command-line flags for the main virtual machine.</p>\n\n<p>The development of PLT Scheme version 4.0 took about one year of hard work.

The final version 4.0 release is just days away.</p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Matthew Flatt</em></p>\n\n<p>PLT Scheme is now 13 years old. The initial version was little more than glue code between a few open-source libraries, which seemed to offer the quickest solution to our modest goals. Modest success leads to bigger goals, however, and then continued success leads to ever more ambitious goals. Before you know it, a mass of users, co-developers, libraries, and documentation rely on design decisions that were made for a much smaller project years before.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, many of those early design decisions turn out to be a poor fit for the project&rsquo;s eventual role. Starting from scratch isn&rsquo;t usually practical, so you gradually adjust the infrastructure to meet new needs. That was precisely the story for the version 300 series of releases for PLT Scheme. The biggest gap between our original and current goals was in run-time performance, so we replaced bytecode interpretation with a just-in-time native-code compiler, and we replaced a memory manager based on &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; estimates of pointer usage with one that uses precise information.</p>\n\n<p>Performance improves a bit more with version 4.0, but mostly we&rsquo;ve moved on to a bigger mismatch between the original and current goals: the way that PLT Scheme presents itself to users. PLT Scheme was originally conceived as R5RS Scheme with some extensions to make it practical, and with useful tools (notably an IDE) and libraries (notably a GUI library) built on that core. Our documentation and web pages reflected that architecture - which now seems completely upside-down.</p>\n\n<p>Version 4.0 is a fresh start in the way that we present PLT Scheme. It&rsquo;s a new language. PLT Scheme is a dialect of Scheme, certainly, but it&rsquo;s not merely a superset of R5RS, R6RS, or other standards, and those standards are not really the best place to start understanding PLT Scheme. At the same time, the unique extensibility features of the PLT Scheme language and tools allow them to support other languages easily, including R5RS (though a new <code>plt-r5rs</code> executable), R6RS, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Improvements to the PLT Scheme language include better syntax for modules, better support for optional and keyword function arguments, more expressive syntax for structure types, streamlined hash-table operations, new syntax for list comprehensions and iterations, a more complete and consistent set of list and string operations, and reduced dependence on mutable pairs. To current users of PLT Scheme, these changes will seem like the big ones behind version 4.0, but they&rsquo;re small compared to the overall re-organization and the accompanying documentation effort.</p>\n\n<p>We wrote hundreds of pages of new documentation, including much more tutorial and overview information. We ported hundreds of pages of existing documents to new a system that produces cleaner, better organized, more consistent output. We will replace the old tangle of web pages (that try to explain a confusing federation of tools) with a simple page about &ldquo;PLT Scheme.&rdquo; We have even streamlined the command-line flags for the main virtual machine.</p>\n\n<p>The development of PLT Scheme version 4.0 took about one year of hard work. In retrospect, that doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad, considering the scale of the existing code base, the number of things that we improved, and the total size of the documentation (about 2000 pages in PDF form). Still, you can imagine how happy we are to arrive at a stable release, and we hope that the improvements in PLT Scheme version 4.0 work as well for everyone else as they do for us.</p>\n\n<p>For a preview, see <a href=\"http://pre.plt-scheme.org/\">http://pre.plt-scheme.org/</a>.

Much of object-oriented programming relies on self-modifying code, if you think about it. Consider the strategy pattern or the state pattern. In object-oriented programs it may appear that we are changing the data, but we are really changing the code.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>I, Object, 28 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Hello, a quick question:</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a scheme guru, but the posted code seems a bit off. Specifically, it looks to me like &lsquo;return&rsquo; is only bound the first time generator is called, so if you used it like:</p>\n\n<p> (generator)  &hellip;  (generator)</p>\n\n<p>On the second call, it would jump back to the first call (since that&rsquo;s what the continuation stored in &lsquo;return&rsquo; is). It seems like it should instead be something like (totally untested):</p>\n\n<p> &hellip;  (lambda (an-element-from-a-list)  (set! return  (call/cc  (lambda (resume-here)  (set! control-state resume-here)  (return an-element-from-a-list)))))  &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>However, as I said, I don&rsquo;t write a lot of scheme, so maybe I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for the terrible formatting, but I&rsquo;m not sure how to tell blogger to display stuff as code.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Dan Doel, 28 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>this is a terrible misuse of call/cc. here is a better implementation:</p>\n\n<p>(define (one-at-a-time lst)  (lambda ()  (if (null? lst)  &rsquo;you-fell-off-the-end  (let ((x (car lst)))  (set! lst (cdr lst))  x))))</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Gavin, 29 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>@Gavin: Actually, it is exactly what the recent call/cc hype was about: To allow implicit (foreach) instead of explicit state machines, esp. in the context of web applications. Imagine the state getting a little bit more complicated. (You&rsquo;d need to hide the call/cc in an abstraction for the generator programmer as well, though.)</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Andreas Krey, 29 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>call/cc is indeed a bad choice if all you&rsquo;re doing is making a generator out of a flat list. However, the technique mentioned works about equally well for turning folds over arbitrary data structures into generators/cursors.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, writing a generator for a binary tree using only the analogues to car/cdr is a pain (I imagine you&rsquo;d manage a stack of nodes to be visited by hand). However, writing an in-order traversal is simple. This example shows that you can turn the latter into the former automatically and generically using call/cc.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, for the particular case of turning a fold into a cursor, delimited continuations are, perhaps, even nicer (and, in a sense, this example might be mimicking delimited continuations with call/cc + state). Something like:</p>\n\n<p>(define (mk-generator traversal structure)  (define (generator) (control-loop))</p>\n\n<p> (define (control-loop)  (reset  (traversal  (lambda (element)  (shift  (lambda (k)  (set! control-loop (lambda () (k #f)))  element)))  structure)  &rsquo;traversal-done))</p>\n\n<p> generator)</p>\n\n<p>Which, handily, avoids having to worry about keeping track of a return continuation for this problem.</p>\n\n<p>The problem of turning folds into cursors in various languages, and the advantages of structuring a collection library in such a way are discussed in more depth here.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Dan Doel, 29 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>Thanks for pointing out the bug.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>This (correct) code is a poem on turning a loop into a generator. It is not serious code.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>And yes, it is writing code like that many times, which first suggested delimited continuations to me in the fall of 1984; it just took three years to write it up.</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>— <em>matthias, 29 July 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Matthias, sorry to be commenting on such an old blog post ;-)</p>\n\n<p>This is a pretty cool example, but I think it would be clearer if the internal defines were desugared into a letrec. It&rsquo;s very odd to see a function definition mutated from inside the function in the first place, but somehow it seems more natural in a letrec. More importantly (for me at least), is that I can understand right away what the continuation of the letrec would be, but it&rsquo;s not at all obvious with the internal define &mdash; it looks as though the continuation of the (define (generator) &hellip;) code would continue by defining control-state again.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Michael, 30 January 2008</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>This is cute; it took me a minute to understand what was going on.

This is especially useful when creating pattern matching macros.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The performance of Redex&rsquo;s matcher has been substantially improved; depending on the model you should see improvements between 2x and 50x in the time it takes to reduce terms.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Plots look nicer and are more correct at very small and very large scales. New features include customizable dual axis ticks and transforms (e.g., log axes, date and currency ticks, axis interval collapse and stretch), stacked histograms, and 3D vector fields. The legacy <code>fit</code> function and libfit have been removed.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The <code>2htdp/universe</code> library&rsquo;s <code>big-bang</code> form supports an experimental game pad key handler.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The <code>db</code> library now supports nested transactions and PostgreSQL arrays. Bugs involving MySQL authentication and memory corruption in the SQLite bindings have been fixed.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The Macro Stepper tool in DrRacket no longer executes a program after expanding it.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>In the DMdA teaching languages, infinite recursive signatures (&ldquo;streams&rdquo;, for example) with no intervening <code>mixed</code> are now supported, and the signatures of record definitions without fields now have generators for use with <code>property</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>MysterX&rsquo;s ActiveX support is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. MysterX&rsquo;s core COM functionality will become deprecated in the next release, but COM functionality will be supported for the foreseeable future as a compatibility layer over a forthcoming <code>ffi/com</code> library.</p></li></ul>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>What is your opinion of Clojure?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Owen, 2 February 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I just compiled and installed the new racket release on my linux laptop!

It is now available in the <code>datalog</code> collection and with <code>#lang datalog</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Racklog provides Prolog-style logic programming in Racket, adapted from Dorai Sitaram&rsquo;s Schelog package. It is available in the <code>racklog</code> collection and now as <code>#lang racklog</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>By default <code>make install</code> and <code>raco setup</code> compile collections in parallel on all available processors. (Use <code>raco setup -j 1</code> to disable, if necessary.)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Changes (as part of 5.0) in the <code>racket</code> language compared to the <code>scheme</code> language: constructor-style printing, a <code>struct</code> alternative to <code>define-struct</code> that fits more naturally with <code>match</code> and constructor-style printing, bytecode-dependency management via SHA&ndash;1 hashes instead of just timestamps (where the <code>openssl/sha1</code> library provides the SHA&ndash;1 hash function), a reorganization of <code>scheme/foreign</code> into <code>ffi/unsafe</code> and associated libraries, and new printing functions <code>eprintf</code> and <code>displayln</code>. Also, a generator from <code>racket/generator</code> is required to have the form <code>(generator () body ...)</code>, which supports a planned extension to let a generator accept arguments.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Changes to the <code>racket</code> language (since 5.0): internal-definition positions allow mixing expressions with definitions, full continuations can escape past a continuation barrier, custodians can attempt to terminate subprocesses and subprocess groups (see <code>current-subprocess-custodian-mode</code>, <code>subprocess-group-enabled</code>), the JIT supports additional unboxing flonum operations and unsafe variants, <code>ffi/unsafe</code> provides an asychronous-call mechanism to deal with foreign threads, a new \".\" modifier for format string directives (e.g., \"~.s\" and \"~.a\") limits the respective output to <code>(error-print-width)</code> characters.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The core type system of Typed Racket has been substantially revised. In particular, Typed Racket can now follow significantly more sophisticated reasoning about the relationships between predicates.

Reloading an expression and reloading the entire buffer are two different things that, while their functionality somewhat overlaps, provide two distinct ways of interacting with Lisp/Scheme expressions. You can have your big &ldquo;Run&rdquo; button for students new to Scheme, but also perhaps provide a keyboard shortcut that would send a definition or expression to the current REPL. One advantage to this is that often times when I&rsquo;m testing my code I&rsquo;ll create temporary variables with dummy data in the REPL, and being able to reload a definition without recreating the test data would be quite a timesaver. In other words, both mechanisms have their uses, and there&rsquo;s no reason why both can&rsquo;t be included. (this is a revision of my first reply, mainly due to some grammar issues)</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Kyle Cronin, 29 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I can understand the motivation behind the design. But this way of working does not work well with my way of developing a program incrementally.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are developing the procedure string-prefix? which answers if a string is a prefix of another. You have a file utils.scm with the definition of string-prefix?</p>\n\n<p>Now you want to test it. Start the REPL and try your definition with a couple of examples. Iterate the process until you have a correct function.</p>\n\n<p>The bad thing here is that all the tests you have developed are only in the REPL and are not saved in the file utils.scm. So if you continue working on your program later and need to verify the definition of string-prefix? you must re-type and re-engineer a test suite for it.</p>\n\n<p>The way I do it, is to have the test suite in comments around the definition and send those tests with send exp and watch for the results.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Pierre, 29 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I, too, do not see why it can&rsquo;t be an option.

In a sane language like Scheme, <code>goto</code> is gone &mdash; but only on the superficial level of what you see when you browse through the report or the manual. An incremental REPL is gone from PLT Scheme in a similarly superficial way: DrScheme does not support it &mdash; but it&rsquo;s still part of the language, and you can still fire up MzScheme and talk to it like any other REPL. More than that, as said in previous comments: it wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to implement a send-last-sexpr functionality in DrScheme. Why was it done so far? For the exact same reason that nobody implemented a <code>prog</code> macro in PLT: nobody really needed it.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 29 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Eli, the article above argues that it is a feature designed into DrScheme. It is one reason I never got warm with DrScheme, it does not support the style of interaction I like. I&rsquo;m old. Bearded. Lisp hacker. I&rsquo;m probably not the &lsquo;target&rsquo; for it. Yeah, how I liked MacScheme - that was fun.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Rainer, 30 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>That was interesting. I am new to Scheme (PLT Scheme) and I have only played with DrScheme so I didn&rsquo;t know there was any other &ldquo;way&rdquo; to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I have read the responses from the &ldquo;incrementalists&rdquo; and I see the point they are making. Couldn&rsquo;t what they want be just another &ldquo;mode&rdquo; for DrScheme? You change the option to &ldquo;Incremental REPL&rdquo; or something and you get the way of working they like.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robert, 30 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Rainer: yes, it is a feature designed into DrScheme. But as mentioned above several times now, it doesn&rsquo;t contradict having the incremental kind of REPL too: all that is needed for that is a simple send-to-repl key, and that&rsquo;s really not too hard to do. See also Robby&rsquo;s reply: it took effort to implement the resetting functionality &mdash; an effort that was made due to the design decision. So DrScheme has an additional feature &mdash; and implementing a send-to-repl key just happens to be a something that is not going to use that feature (making it even easier to implement). Back for the reason why it wasn&rsquo;t implemented so far: it&rsquo;s because once people got used to it, they liked it. Once they liked it, they saw no need to implement support for the old mode of work. It&rsquo;s actually quite similar to why we use S-expression syntax: once people got used to that, they didn&rsquo;t see any reason to go back and implement M-expressions as originally planned.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 30 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I do the vast majority of my programming as a scientist (in Matlab, unfortunately). However, I recently did some consulting work where the language I used was not important and so chose to use PLTScheme. Like my scientific work, though, this consulting involved a lot of large data sets which one wanted to load, and then interactively transform - generally speaking such &ldquo;exploratory data analysis&rdquo; is not a process for which large scale program design is very useful. What is useful is to be able to load large data sets (or perform long simulations or calculations) once, storing them in variables in a running interpreter, and then interactively plot and/or analyze the results - a process which often involves sending partial expressions to a running process to be evaluated. Had I been able to do this in DrScheme I might have used the environment. The absence of this feature was definitely irksome enough that I decided to use Emacs and Quack for my development instead.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many other programmers out there are use their programming languages as extensions of their ability to visualize and analyze data rather than as systems to design applications, but I would suspect it is a fair number. For them, it may be worth the confusion to allow incremental compilation/evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>J.V. Toups, 30 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>No matter &mdash; old Lispers can just post  to them newfangled Wikis to see the  effect of small changes in state on  the big picture.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; Paul</p>\n\n<p>— <em>steck, 31 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>J.V., the data analysis problem is precisely the kind of process where a specialized environment is possibly superior to the old incremental Emacs mode. Just like writing shell scripts is neat once you have figured out how to use the Language dialog to preset command line arguments.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>matthias, 31 March 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Why so much fuss about it? Like Grant pointed out, I generally develop and refine functions in the REPL and when I&rsquo;m satisfied with it, I write it to the definitions buffer. You may also copy from the definitions, copy on the REPL and further refine it, despite the &ldquo;out of sync&rdquo; alert.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>namekuseijin, 2 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>namekuseijin,</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can also program with one arm tied behind your back. It&rsquo;s just not very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re programming in this style proves that you would benefit from a less restrictive environment. It also proves that the argument that &ldquo;nobody implemented it, because nobody needed it&rdquo; is not really valid. We have actually already seen a few people mentioning here that they would &ldquo;need&rdquo; it. But unfortunately, many programmers just use whatever they are given and don&rsquo;t question their tools too much, and instead use workarounds, like you seem to do in this case.</p>\n\n<p>You see this also a lot in the Java world. So, indeed, nothing much is really fundamental and critical to anything&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Pascal Costanza, 2 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>&ldquo;A less restrictive environment&rdquo; is bogus: the environment lacks a keypress that makes copy-from-definitions-paste-to-repl easier, but it is <em>not</em> restricted. Confusing that with &ldquo;a restriction&rdquo; is what makes you draw other bogus conclusions, so I&rsquo;ll stop here.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 2 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Pascal, like I said I usually just work out the functions at the excellent command line &mdash; complete with full command history, completion and parenthetical editing &mdash; and then paste to the definitions once I&rsquo;m done.</p>\n\n<p>If I ever have to redefine it, I may just either access the command history (even from previous closed sessions) or, from your usual emacs position when doing the same (in the tail of a definition), do: Alt+Shift+&lt;- (to select the definition) Ctrl+C (to copy) Ctrl+D (do go to interactions) Ctrl+V+Enter (to rerun the definition)</p>\n\n<p>Hardly Earth-shattering, specially in the face of the powerful command-line editing. But yeah, the above procedure could be turned into a single step with something as keybinding customization. Section 3.3.7 of the DrScheme environment manual spill out the details.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve grown on Emacs, but got fed up of all the baroqueness and hand dextery. I&rsquo;m no virtuoso pianist.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>namekuseijin, 3 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>namekuseijin,</p>\n\n<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s possible to find workarounds to get what you want. And there may indeed be very good reasons to stick to these workarounds, because you deem other things more important than this.</p>\n\n<p>But note that your suggested workaround makes things even harder to follow than what Matthias describes in his blog posting. Not only do you now have to track which definitions actually resemble closest the current state of the image, you also have to track them down in a long list of definitions that is ordered by history rather than by some program logic.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, emacs is a straw man here. I don&rsquo;t like emacs that much either. But there are much better alternatives, like the IDEs for Macintosh Common Lisp, LispWorks, Allegro Common Lisp, and Corman Lisp, to name just a few current ones.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in LispWorks I can choose to define the current selected form in the buffer - or even undefine it! - by clicking the respective entries in the contextual menu that I get, as usual, by right-clicking. I can also select several forms in a row and define or undefine them in one go, which makes it already a lot easier to have some confidence in a consistent state of the system. And by using a system definition facility, it is also quite straightforward to do a complete reload of everything, but without invalidating all the data on which I want to test my definitions.</p>\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s Common Lisp, and that&rsquo;s worse than Scheme in every respect, right? So much for religion&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Pascal Costanza, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Pascal: your comments go down a line where each is more bogus than the previous. You now claim that namekuseijin&rsquo;s method is harder because definitions don&rsquo;t follow some mythical &ldquo;program logic&rdquo;. With any conventional REPL (including the one in DrScheme and in MzScheme) there is no &ldquo;program logic&rdquo; that dictates the ordering of definitions entered on the REPL &mdash; there is just the history of whatever you happen to have typed in. The core of Matthias&rsquo;s post is exactly about that: this history leads to hidden dependencies (and therefore bugs) that are not evident in your code.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there are some Lisps that will allow you to dump the current runtime image &mdash; and yes, you can use that as a kind of a formalization of the history as &ldquo;the code&rdquo; &mdash; but trying to write real software (one that requires maintenance) this way is crazy. The problems involved in doing this kind of development are hard, and &mdash; AFAIK &mdash; no Lisp is actually trying to solve them <em>properly</em>. Ad-hoc &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; involve tools similar to what you mention: undefining a name, retroactively defining a name, etc. CLOS is a good example in the retroactive-change attempt: defining an already existing class has some complex semantics that try to update previously defined instances, and that tends to work only with very simple classes. In the more common cases you end up facing a need for <code>update-instance-for-redefined-class</code> &mdash; which means that you now need to actually write code around the problem inherent in REPLs. Worse, if the redefinition is due to change in your source, this code is a one-time throwaway tool that will never be used outside of your currently outdated REPL.</p>\n\n<p>IME, I found myself reaching a similar conclusion to Matthias: in theory, I can maintain the REPL, and I can invest some effort in doing so by writing update methods. In practice, it&rsquo;s just easier to restart the REPL and be done with it. It&rsquo;s nice to have a REPL, and it&rsquo;s easy to get carried away with it to the point where I write code for the sake of not killing it &mdash; and at that point a relevant question is whether the REPL is helping me or whether I&rsquo;m helping the REPL.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that the Lisp world is infested with loading-order problems, and there are a good number of packages (and correspondingly a good amount of human effort) that try to solve these issues. And this is not some theoretical &ldquo;we had a problem and now it&rsquo;s solved&rdquo; &mdash; I see people who are running into these problems today, and I see people who are working on these problems today.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Eli,</p>\n\n<p>If you send definitions from the buffer to the image, or send commands to undefine them, then you can preserve the arrangement of the program text according to some program logic. This has nothing to do with the REPL. (Corman Lisp seems very interesting here because it actually does not make the distinction between a buffer and a REPL anymore, but gives you only buffers from which you can interact with the image.)</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s good that you have reached some conclusions and stick to a certain programming style. But why do you (or Matthias) make attempts to impose your own views on others?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Pascal Costanza, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Never thought blogs could be as amusing as usenet. :)</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll get onto Corman Lisp when I&rsquo;m fed up with DrScheme&rsquo;s interaction style. should take a while&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>— <em>namekuseijin, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Pascal,</p>\n\n<p> No one is imposing their will on others.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, others have explaining how one might build the kind of interactions you propose into DrScheme, if you were so inclined. As I said in a rather obtuse way earlier (for which I apologize), it takes work to do such things. If someone deems it important, they can certainly do it. I&rsquo;d be more than happy to help if said person gets stuck in trying.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robby, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Pascal,</p>\n\n<p>Re &ldquo;If you send definitions from the buffer to the image, or send commands to undefine them&rdquo; &mdash; that would be equivalent to writing your program with <code>eval</code>. While this is available in a number of languages including outside of the Lisp world, I have yet to see anyone writing &ldquo;Real&rdquo; code that way, for exactly the same reason I mentioned earlier: maintaining such code would be a nightmare. (And this is even if your environment provides your with more powerful eval-like primitives like querying the current bindings, or removing a binding &mdash; all existing in MzScheme (and in DrScheme, of course) too, BTW.)</p>\n\n<p>And re &ldquo;make attempts to impose your own views on others&rdquo; &mdash; where did I do that?? MzScheme <em>does</em> have these feature, DrScheme only <em>adds</em> a feature on top of MzScheme. Like I said about 2000 times now, the only thing that is actually missing from DrScheme would be a convenient &ldquo;send the current expression to the REPL&rdquo; key &mdash; which is very likely to be very easy to add. I also said that nobody did this because nobody has seen any burning need to do so. I can tell you even more: I <em>do</em> use the REPL to debug code every once in a while. Why didn&rsquo;t I bother adding that feature? Well, I said that too: I know where Emacs is when I need it, and Emacs is already doing what Emacs is doing very well &mdash; I have absolutely no desire to compete with it.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 4 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Having read through the comments, while I can understand the reasoning behind not having a &ldquo;send the current expression to the REPL&rdquo; key, it seems that there are two distinct schools of thought here, with no middle ground.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to support both schools would probably be to have two distinct modes, one for each of both. I, for one, could definitely use both, each for different purposes.</p>\n\n<p>One reason that I still keep MIT/GNU Scheme around is that I like its feature to use C-x C-e to return the current expression to the REPL. It is actually convenient when working through such a book as SICP, because then I can keep a running log of the current session history without resetting the session every time I change a definition. It is also one reason that I haven&rsquo;t used DrScheme for SICP yet.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I can see Matthias&rsquo;s point in re-starting the REPL and re-loading the definitions buffer for users who have difficulty in keeping track of the state of the REPL.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that effort was spent in making DrScheme&rsquo;s REPL transparent, and that it wasn&rsquo;t transparent before, why not retain the current mode in as a &ldquo;non-interactive mode,&rdquo; and simply create an alternative &ldquo;interactive mode&rdquo; based on code from the code base of an earlier version of DrScheme before that change was made.</p>\n\n<p>This should not take too much effort, and should be acceptable by both camps. It would resolve this conflict, and add a useful alternative, making DrScheme acceptable to both schools of interaction.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Benjamin L. Russell, 8 April 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Ok, so here is a try to create a keybinding to push a sexp to the interaction windows (I&rsquo;m not sure I will personally use this though):</p>\n\n<p>In &ldquo;keys.ss&rdquo; that defines my DrScheme keybindings, I bind &ldquo;c:e&rdquo; with a function that takes an editor and an event. Then I use: (send (send editor get-keymap) call-function &ldquo;select-backward-sexp&rdquo; editor event #f) and calls alike with &ldquo;shift-focus&rdquo;, &ldquo;copy-clipboard&rdquo;, &hellip;</p>\n\n<p>The problem is once &ldquo;shift-focus&rdquo; has been called, the focused editor has changed, but I don&rsquo;t know what it is, so I can&rsquo;t call &ldquo;paste-clipboard&rdquo; on the new editor (the interaction window in fact, which I&rsquo;m not sure is really an editor). So how do I get the editor under focus? Or how do I get the interactions editor?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Laurent, 22 January 2010</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve added a note to the keybindings documentation that comes with the code to implement a few of the standard &lsquo;send things to the repl&rsquo; keybindings.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Robby, 24 September 2011</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 73) f post (u .

The region provides a true contract boundary, in that uses of contracted exports within the region are unprotected. Contract regions are specified with the <code>with-contract</code> form.

The &lsquo;stx&rsquo; of <code>datum-&gt;syntax-object</code> is the syntactic context of the new macro but it doesn&rsquo;t bind yield; it just uses it.

The &lsquo;stx&rsquo; of <code>datum-&gt;syntax-object</code> is the syntactic context of the new macro but it doesn&rsquo;t bind yield; it just uses it. So the definition of <code>yield</code> in <code>define/y</code> must be a different one according to the hygiene standards. Ergo yield is free at the top-level [MzScheme] or bound to the yield import from MrEd [Pretty Big].</p>\n\n<p>How can we try to fix this? The explanation suggests we use a different macro definition for <code>define/y</code>, one that uses a context that is guaranteed from the body of an instance of <code>define/y</code>:</p>\n\n<div

Of course, then I had to go back and replace all occurrences of both x.0 and y.0 with x.1 and release again. To avoid this headache, we need a way to express self-referential module paths with precise, implicit version numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The built-in module paths don&rsquo;t quite support this.

This has given the Racket package system another cycle of attention. Whenever this happens, there are often questions and confusion about how to solve various distribution problems with the package system. A natural point of comparison is the older PLaneT system provided by Racket that appears to solve similar problems. In this blog post, I attempt to explain the purpose of the package system and its relation to PLaneT.</p>\n\n<p>The package system and PLaneT do not solve the same problem and don&rsquo;t exist for the same reason.</p>\n\n<p>PLaneT is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>A file distribution mechanism for source code.</p>\n  <p>Via <code>.plt</code> files that are installed into a particular place on your machine and then <code>raco setup</code>&rsquo;d.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>A mechanism for automatically downloading and installing source code just before it is needed by programs.</p>\n  <p>Via the <code>(planet ...)</code> require form.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>A centralized database of libraries</p>\n  <p>Via the PLaneT website and its server &amp; protocol which were undocumented and proprietary for the majority of PLaneT&rsquo;s life</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>A prescriptive model of how programs and libraries should be composed.</p>\n  <p>Specifically the system of major/minor versions, tagging packages by author name, and embedding the names of packages in source code.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>In contrast, the package system is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>A file distribution mechanism for source code, byte code, and documentation. Via the <code>raco pkg</code> command.</li></ul>\n\n<p>In this way, the package system is almost identical to an operating system package system like Debian&rsquo;s dpkg and apt systems. The problem is very finely tailored and becomes more flexible as a result (notice that we can now distribute byte code and documentation.) This design aspires to follow the admonition of <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/r3rs_2.html#SEC2\">holy writ</a>: &ldquo;Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it was intended to solve practical problems throughout the Racket ecosystem. In particular, one of the common complaints people had and have about PLaneT is the very long install times because of long builds. The package system allows this problem to be solved by distributing pre-built code.</p>\n\n<p>Since the package system specifically does not address jobs 2, 3, or 4 of PLaneT, we have to ask, &ldquo;Do they need to be solved?&rdquo; and if so, &ldquo;How can we solve them on top of the package system, i.e. as a library in honor of the design principle?&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, 2 and 3 are very painful for people wanting to just use the file distribution mechanism of PLaneT. 2 causes unpredictability, because you don&rsquo;t know if running a program will start a long invocation of &ldquo;raco setup&rdquo;, require Internet access, and start running un-vetted code. 3 requires you to share your code if you want to use the file distribution mechanism and is a single point of failure for doing installation.</p>\n\n<p>By not mandating how to address 2 and 3 in the package system, we offer flexibility. Here is where the solutions to these jobs are now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  <p>There is currently no way to get automatic installs of packages. However, both DrRacket and xrepl offer advice about which packages you might want to install to compile and run the program. It would be natural to extend this advice to be automatic and patches are welcome. Given the experiences of operating systems which merely make suggestions (<code>nethack: command not found, provided by nethack-console</code>), I personally feel like we are at the sweet spot.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The file distribution mechanism&rsquo;s flexible package sources combine with a very simple protocol for package catalogs (Take a URL, add<code>/pkg/</code>, add a string, get a <code>read</code>-able hash table) to look up packages you don&rsquo;t yet have. As a service, we run a few catalogs (one for each release, plus <a href=\"http://pkgs.racket-lang.org\">pkgs.r-l.o</a>). But we expect that users with special needs (such as sensitive installations that need exactly certain tested and trusted versions, especially with proprietary software) will build their own catalogs on private Web sites.</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>Clearly, however, job 4 is where PLaneT and the package system differ the most.</p>\n\n<p>With the package system, we follow the precedent of operating systems. An OS package&rsquo;s job is to get files into the right spot. An OS package contains a binary and instructions to install it as <code>/usr/bin/zsh</code>. It is not typical in OSes to be able to install multiple packages (such as different &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of the &ldquo;same&rdquo; package) that both provide <code>/usr/bin/zsh</code>. When you&rsquo;re at a Unix prompt, you don&rsquo;t have to write <code>zsh-5.0.5/usr/bin/zsh</code>. It&rsquo;s possible that many consider this is a big problem with OSes and indeed we do observe that it is fairly common to provide packages that provide binaries and libraries with embedded names such as how on my machine I have <code>python2.6</code>, <code>python2.7</code>, and <code>python3.2</code> all in my <code>$PATH</code>. It is important to realize, however, that the <code>deb</code> format and the <code>apt</code> tool didn&rsquo;t need to change to support this change or future changes in perspective in how to compose code.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this analogy helps understand the Racket package system. In the package system, a package doesn&rsquo;t install &ldquo;binaries&rdquo;, &ldquo;man pages&rdquo;, and &ldquo;init scripts&rdquo;, but installs similar things, such as &ldquo;module paths&rdquo;, &ldquo;documentation manuals&rdquo;, and \"<code>raco</code> commands\". Each of these has a notion of conflict: can&rsquo;t have two <code>zsh</code>s or two <code>racket/list</code>s; can&rsquo;t have two <code>zsh.1</code> pages or two docs named <code>doc</code>; can&rsquo;t have two modules trying to provide <code>raco neo-tokyo-is-about-to-explode</code>. If you find a random <code>.deb</code> on the Internet, can you predict what binaries it will contain from its name? No. The same goes for Racket packages. However, if you are egregiously weird, then people probably won&rsquo;t want to install your packages, just like for random <code>deb</code>s.</p>\n\n<p>However, clearly rules are helpful. In the world of operating systems, you know that basically all packages distributed by Debian can be installed at the same time, except for &ldquo;virtual packages&rdquo; that do stuff like selecting whether <code>postfix</code> or <code>sendmail</code> should be responsible for the <code>sendmail</code> command. These rules are not enforced through technology, though. Instead, the Debian maintainers have a social process that enforces them, with information being provided by technology (such as regression systems that identify unintended conflicts.) The catalog server that the Racket team provides helps facilitate a similar process with the concentric rings (all ring &lt;=1 packages can be installed at once and ring 1&lt; packages can do anything.)</p>\n\n<p>Non-conflicting sets of packages is the simplest rule to define and enforce. Other rules about backwards compatibility are much more complicated to define and enforce. I do not believe there is much precedent in the world of OSes, although we can see a little bit of what they do through things like <code>libgtk</code>, <code>libgtk2</code>, and <code>libgtk3</code>, where generally code written for one <code>libgtk2</code> package is compatible with all <code>libgtk2</code> packages made in the future, but <code>libgtk3</code> is effectively a totally different package and introduces totally separate binaries like <code>gtk3-config</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The most that the Racket team attempts to do here is to say, &ldquo;Here are the rules we will follow and we think you should follow them too.&rdquo; Specifically, that we will maintain backwards compatibility or make a new package. We can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t enforce this, nor do we always live up to it with our own work (but we feel really bad about it when we do.)</p>\n\n<p>Although my main goal of this section has been to explain my solution to (4), a great thing about the package system is that it is not binding at all. You can decide to follow the same rules as PLaneT. It is easy to do so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Always name your packages <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE-$MAJOR</code></p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Always provide modules from only the collection, <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE-$MAJOR</code></p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Maintain backwards compatibility within releases of <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE-$MAJOR</code></p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Update the <code>'version</code> metadata in the package <code>info.rkt</code> to reflect the <code>$MINOR</code> version.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>And, boom!, you&rsquo;ve recreated the rules of PLaneT to a T except for two things: (a) you&rsquo;ll still need to put a dependency on <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE-$MAJOR</code> on the outside of code in a package <code>info.rkt</code> file rather than just inside files and (b) you can&rsquo;t use <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE</code> to refer to &ldquo;whatever the current <code>$MAJOR</code>&rdquo; is.</p>\n\n<p>The first compromise of adding something to the <code>info.rkt</code> is fairly modest, as it requires O(1) line modifications.</p>\n\n<p>The second compromise is more severe, although actually you could just maintain such a package and deal with the breakage that occurs when you try to upgrade. Such breakage, however, was present in PLaneT too, as when a package was installed based on <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE</code> only the local machine would cache the version used, so if you took the requiring module to another machine, it would download a new version and, potentially, have a backwards incompatibility problem. Using the package system in the most naive way (i.e. installing the <code>$AUTHOR-$PACKAGE</code> at some point and programming to that) would work exactly the same as PLaneT, except that the package system was designed to be able to port installations from one machine to another with <code>raco pkg migrate</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this blog post has helped explain the package system and shown that it does not prevent you from doing anything that PLaneT let you do, it only allows you to do more.</p>") #t (u .

NPM uses semver to manage dependency versions, and it works well. The node-semver package demonstrates how this versioning works. A semver string is then included a module&rsquo;s dependencies list, which can specify all sorts of things, including &ldquo;use the latest version of the library,&rdquo; &ldquo;use the latest version given a particular major.minor string,&rdquo; and &ldquo;use this precise major.minor.patch&rdquo; version.</p>\n\n<p>NPM handles the rest, downloading the correct version of the dependencies. The reason this is tricky is that this requires every module to have its own set of dependencies, since different modules can request different versions of packages. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how Node handles loading multiple versions of the same dependency with regards to performance and interaction, though it might be worth looking into.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the Racket package manager provides very little versioning support, and packages have to be installed in an entire user or installation scope, rather than having module-specific dependency versioning. Is this bad? I don&rsquo;t know.

Essentially, every dependancy you install is local to your package, and no other packages can access them. Your dependancies, in turn have a tree of packages that you can&rsquo;t access. In other words, every single package gets a separate copy of its dependancies. This might seem terrible, but the node community is deeply rooted in UNIX, so most packages expose only a few functions doing one thing well, and so the overhead of having many copies is very low.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>g145, 4 September 2015</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 94) f post (u .

The power of submodules is that they can be separately loaded and separately run relative to their enclosing modules, in the same way that top-level modules can be separately load and run.

That is, <code>#lang</code> is in principle the only top-level form in Racket. With only modules at the top level, however, macros cannot abstract over sets of top-level modules.</p>\n\n<p>Submodules provide more flexibility, in that a macro defined within a module can abstract over a set of submodules. As it happens, abstracting over a set of submodules is useful for defining a new language for use with <code>#lang</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A language for use with <code>#lang</code> is implemented by several pieces that live at different times, including the language’s parser, the language’s run-time support library, and the language’s syntax-coloring plug-in for DrRacket. Formerly, a programmer who implements a language with those three pieces was forced to write three different modules (or else tangle the different pieces in a single module, which invariably pulls too many dependencies into any one of them). Those pieces now can be in submodules, which opens the possibility for new abstractions that conveniently generate the various pieces of a language.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to define an <code>ocean</code> language that is <code>racket/base</code> plus <code>fish</code>, it’s enough to install the following module as <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> in an <code>\"ocean\"</code> collection (e.g., in an <code>\"ocean\"</code> directory is that is registered as a collection with the command <code>raco link ocean</code>):</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"kn\">#lang </span><span class=\"nn\">racket/base</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._provide))\" style=\"color: inherit\">provide</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._all-from-out))\" style=\"color: inherit\">all-from-out</a></span> <span class=\"n\">racket/base</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n         <span class=\"n\">fish</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">fish</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Writing.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/misc..rkt)._displayln))\" style=\"color: inherit\">displayln</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Fish are swimming\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/module.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._module))\" style=\"color: inherit\">module</a></span> <span class=\"n\">reader</span> <span class=\"n\">syntax/module-reader</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">#:language</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">ocean</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>When Racket sees a module that starts <code>#lang ocean</code>, it does not simply load the <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> module of the <code>\"ocean\"</code> collection. Instead, <code>#lang</code> looks for a reader submodule of the <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> module. The reader module above does not depend on its enclosing module, so that parsing a module in the ocean language does not trigger the “Fish are swimming” printout. Instead, the <code>#:language 'ocean</code> part of the reader submodule indicates that a module parsed from <code>#lang ocean</code> starts by importing the <code>ocean</code> module, so the bindings of <code>ocean</code> are available in the program, and “Fish are swimming” will print when the program is run.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"submodules-are-like\">Submodules are Like&hellip;</h2>\n\n<p>At some level, syntactic nesting of modules is an obvious feature to include in a module system. Nevertheless, Racket’s submodules are not like nested modules in most languages—including Python, Chez, or ML—where nesting is for namespace management and nested modules are always instantiated along with the enclosing module. Racket submodules can be used in a similar way, but the fact that submodules are separately loadable makes them available to solve a larger class of problems.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to pick just one analogy, I’d say that submodules are most like a generalization of annotations in the Java sense. Java annotations allow the decoration of code with metadata, and the annotations are preserved through run time, so that annotations can be inspected in source, in compiled code, or reflectively at run time. Java annotations are limited to data, so that any abstraction or programatic interpretation of the data depends on yet another external tool and language, or else the code part (such as test to run for a <code>@Test</code> annotation) is difficult to separate from the main program. C# attributes are slightly more general, in that the data can have associated methods, but attribute code is still mingled with run-time code. Submodules generalize annotations to make them “live,” so that the language of annotations can include expressions, functions, and even syntactic extensions, while allowing the annotation/submodule code to stay separate from the base code.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on submodules, see the pre-release Guide section.</p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Matthew Flatt</em></p>\n\n<p>A Racket submodule is a module that is syntactically nested within another module. Submodules will be supported in the next release of Racket, and they are available in the current <a href=\"http://pre.racket-lang.org/installers/\">pre-release version</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Submodules provide nested namespaces, but that kind of nesting is already available through forms like <code>define-package</code>. The power of submodules is that they can be separately loaded and separately run relative to their enclosing modules, in the same way that top-level modules can be separately load and run. This separation of dependencies means that submodules can be used to add code and information to modules—such as tests, documentation, and parsing information—that is loaded only when specifically requested.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-main-submodule\">The <code>main</code> Submodule</h2>\n\n<p>One use of a submodule is to declare a <code>main</code> submodule.

That is, <code>#lang</code> is in principle the only top-level form in Racket. With only modules at the top level, however, macros cannot abstract over sets of top-level modules.</p>\n\n<p>Submodules provide more flexibility, in that a macro defined within a module can abstract over a set of submodules. As it happens, abstracting over a set of submodules is useful for defining a new language for use with <code>#lang</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A language for use with <code>#lang</code> is implemented by several pieces that live at different times, including the language’s parser, the language’s run-time support library, and the language’s syntax-coloring plug-in for DrRacket. Formerly, a programmer who implements a language with those three pieces was forced to write three different modules (or else tangle the different pieces in a single module, which invariably pulls too many dependencies into any one of them). Those pieces now can be in submodules, which opens the possibility for new abstractions that conveniently generate the various pieces of a language.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to define an <code>ocean</code> language that is <code>racket/base</code> plus <code>fish</code>, it’s enough to install the following module as <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> in an <code>\"ocean\"</code> collection (e.g., in an <code>\"ocean\"</code> directory is that is registered as a collection with the command <code>raco link ocean</code>):</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"kn\">#lang </span><span class=\"nn\">racket/base</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._provide))\" style=\"color: inherit\">provide</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._all-from-out))\" style=\"color: inherit\">all-from-out</a></span> <span class=\"n\">racket/base</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n         <span class=\"n\">fish</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">fish</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Writing.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/misc..rkt)._displayln))\" style=\"color: inherit\">displayln</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Fish are swimming\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/module.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._module))\" style=\"color: inherit\">module</a></span> <span class=\"n\">reader</span> <span class=\"n\">syntax/module-reader</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">#:language</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">ocean</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>When Racket sees a module that starts <code>#lang ocean</code>, it does not simply load the <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> module of the <code>\"ocean\"</code> collection. Instead, <code>#lang</code> looks for a reader submodule of the <code>\"main.rkt\"</code> module. The reader module above does not depend on its enclosing module, so that parsing a module in the ocean language does not trigger the “Fish are swimming” printout. Instead, the <code>#:language 'ocean</code> part of the reader submodule indicates that a module parsed from <code>#lang ocean</code> starts by importing the <code>ocean</code> module, so the bindings of <code>ocean</code> are available in the program, and “Fish are swimming” will print when the program is run.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"submodules-are-like\">Submodules are Like&hellip;</h2>\n\n<p>At some level, syntactic nesting of modules is an obvious feature to include in a module system. Nevertheless, Racket’s submodules are not like nested modules in most languages—including Python, Chez, or ML—where nesting is for namespace management and nested modules are always instantiated along with the enclosing module. Racket submodules can be used in a similar way, but the fact that submodules are separately loadable makes them available to solve a larger class of problems.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to pick just one analogy, I’d say that submodules are most like a generalization of annotations in the Java sense. Java annotations allow the decoration of code with metadata, and the annotations are preserved through run time, so that annotations can be inspected in source, in compiled code, or reflectively at run time. Java annotations are limited to data, so that any abstraction or programatic interpretation of the data depends on yet another external tool and language, or else the code part (such as test to run for a <code>@Test</code> annotation) is difficult to separate from the main program. C# attributes are slightly more general, in that the data can have associated methods, but attribute code is still mingled with run-time code. Submodules generalize annotations to make them “live,” so that the language of annotations can include expressions, functions, and even syntactic extensions, while allowing the annotation/submodule code to stay separate from the base code.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on submodules, see the pre-release Guide section.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>That was enormously helpful.

Others were spun off as their own packages. The remaining APIs, which we judged too narrow or too immature, we left in <code>unstable</code> packages, where they are still available in their original form. In all cases, the original <code>unstable</code> libraries continue to export the same bindings they always did, to ensure backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness, here is a list of the fate of each unstable library that used to be part of the main distribution.</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><code>unstable/2d</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Moved to the <code>2d</code> package.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/arrow</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/automata</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Moved to the <code>automata</code> package.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/bytes</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/class-iop</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Moved to the <code>class-iop</code> package.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/contract</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>non-empty-string?</code> to <code>racket/string</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>port-number?</code> and <code>tcp-listen-port?</code> to <code>racket/tcp</code>, the latter renamed to <code>listen-port-number?</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>if/c</code>, <code>failure-result/c</code>, <code>predicate/c</code> and <code>rename-contract</code> to <code>racket/contract</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>treeof</code> to <code>plot/utils</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>sequence/c</code> to <code>racket/sequence</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Left <code>path-piece?</code>, <code>maybe/c</code>, <code>truth/c</code> in <code>unstable-contract-lib</code>.</p></li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/custom-write</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    <p>Moved <code>make-constructor-style-printer</code> to <code>racket/struct</code>.</p></li>\n   <li>\n    <p>Left <code>prop:auto-custom-write</code> in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</p></li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/debug</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-debug-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/define</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/error</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/find</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Left in <code>unstable-lib</code>.</li></ul></li>\n <li><code>unstable/flonum</code>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Superseded by <code>math/flonum</code>.

In this blog post, I’ll offer a slightly expanded commentary about the new library. For the ten-minute video explanation, see the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYtm9YG4tMM\">Youtube</a> video. The accompanying slides are available <a href=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/asumu/slides/racketcon-2012-generics.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Probably the first question that comes to your mind is: what are generics and what do we mean by generic programming? Let me illustrate with some example code:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">vector-ref#</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n<span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list-ref))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list-ref</a></span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Both of the lines above operate on sequence-like datatypes, but for each of the datatypes we use different functions: <code>vector-ref</code> and <code>list-ref</code>. This is also the case with other datatypes like dictionary-like datatypes: <code>hash-ref</code>, <code>assoc</code>, etc. Or all the different kinds of equality: <code>string=?</code>, <code>boolean=?</code>, and <code>=</code>. These specialized operations may seem redundant. Ideally, we’d have generic functions that don’t care about the specific datatypes that we operate over.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Racket does provide these. For dictionaries, we have functions like <code>dict-ref</code> and <code>dict-set</code> that operate over any kind of dictionary-like type. For sequences, <code>sequence-ref</code>, <code>sequence-append</code>, and so on. These generic interfaces are all built-in to the standard library. You might wonder, however, if you can define your own generic functions.</p>\n\n<p>As of version 5.3, you just need to (require racket/generic) to get all the tools you need to define your own generic interface. In the rest of the article I’ll show you how to define your own generic interface and how to use it. If you’ve seen Rust’s <a href=\"http://pcwalton.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/a-gentle-introduction-to-traits-in-rust\">traits</a> or Clojure’s <a href=\"http://clojure.org/protocols\">protocols</a>, our design will feel familiar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n\n<p>The running example will be the implementation of a simple queue interface. Our queue will contain five operations: <code>queue-enqueue</code>, <code>queue-dequeue</code>, <code>queue-head</code>, <code>queue-empty?</code>, and <code>queue-length</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to require the library:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">requireracket/generic</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Then we use define-generics to define a generic interface:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/struct-generics.html#(form._((lib._racket/generic..rkt)._define-generics))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define-generics</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-enqueue</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span> <span class=\"n\">elem</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-dequeue</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-head</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/data/Imperative_Queues.html#(def._((lib._data/queue..rkt)._queue-empty~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">queue-empty?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/data/Imperative_Queues.html#(def._((lib._data/queue..rkt)._queue-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">queue-length</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The method headers above define the methods that concrete implementations of the generic interface need to provide. Each header needs to contain at least one argument that matches the name of the interface; this argument will be used for dispatch. The form defines several identifiers: queue?, gen:queue, queue/c, and each of the generic functions. The first is a predicate that checks whether a given value implements the interface. The identifier prefixed with gen: is a binding that’s used to supply methods for the interface. The queue/c specifies a contract combinator for the interface, which I’ll describe later in the article.</p>\n\n<p>We now have the generic functions, but they’re not very useful without concrete implementations. To implement a generic interface, you first need to define a structure type. We’ll define a simple functional queue(Okasaki 1998, p.42) that uses two lists:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define-struct.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._struct))\" style=\"color: inherit\">struct</a></span> <span class=\"n\">simple-queue</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">front</span> <span class=\"n\">back</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">#:methods</span> <span class=\"n\">gen:queue</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"c1\">;

The new library is still under active development and we plan to experiment with additional features and performance improvements.

Purely Functional Data Structures. Cambridge University Press, 1998.</p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Asumu Takikawa</em></p>\n\n<p>Recently at <a href=\"http://con.racket-lang.org/\">RacketCon</a>, I gave a talk about the new Generics library that ships with Racket 5.3. In this blog post, I’ll offer a slightly expanded commentary about the new library. For the ten-minute video explanation, see the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYtm9YG4tMM\">Youtube</a> video. The accompanying slides are available <a href=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/asumu/slides/racketcon-2012-generics.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Probably the first question that comes to your mind is: what are generics and what do we mean by generic programming? Let me illustrate with some example code:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">vector-ref#</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n<span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list-ref))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list-ref</a></span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"mi\">3</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Both of the lines above operate on sequence-like datatypes, but for each of the datatypes we use different functions: <code>vector-ref</code> and <code>list-ref</code>. This is also the case with other datatypes like dictionary-like datatypes: <code>hash-ref</code>, <code>assoc</code>, etc. Or all the different kinds of equality: <code>string=?</code>, <code>boolean=?</code>, and <code>=</code>. These specialized operations may seem redundant. Ideally, we’d have generic functions that don’t care about the specific datatypes that we operate over.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Racket does provide these. For dictionaries, we have functions like <code>dict-ref</code> and <code>dict-set</code> that operate over any kind of dictionary-like type. For sequences, <code>sequence-ref</code>, <code>sequence-append</code>, and so on. These generic interfaces are all built-in to the standard library. You might wonder, however, if you can define your own generic functions.</p>\n\n<p>As of version 5.3, you just need to (require racket/generic) to get all the tools you need to define your own generic interface. In the rest of the article I’ll show you how to define your own generic interface and how to use it. If you’ve seen Rust’s <a href=\"http://pcwalton.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/a-gentle-introduction-to-traits-in-rust\">traits</a> or Clojure’s <a href=\"http://clojure.org/protocols\">protocols</a>, our design will feel familiar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n\n<p>The running example will be the implementation of a simple queue interface. Our queue will contain five operations: <code>queue-enqueue</code>, <code>queue-dequeue</code>, <code>queue-head</code>, <code>queue-empty?</code>, and <code>queue-length</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to require the library:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">requireracket/generic</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Then we use define-generics to define a generic interface:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/struct-generics.html#(form._((lib._racket/generic..rkt)._define-generics))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define-generics</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-enqueue</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span> <span class=\"n\">elem</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-dequeue</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">queue-head</span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/data/Imperative_Queues.html#(def._((lib._data/queue..rkt)._queue-empty~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">queue-empty?</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/data/Imperative_Queues.html#(def._((lib._data/queue..rkt)._queue-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">queue-length</a></span> <span class=\"n\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The method headers above define the methods that concrete implementations of the generic interface need to provide. Each header needs to contain at least one argument that matches the name of the interface; this argument will be used for dispatch. The form defines several identifiers: queue?, gen:queue, queue/c, and each of the generic functions. The first is a predicate that checks whether a given value implements the interface. The identifier prefixed with gen: is a binding that’s used to supply methods for the interface. The queue/c specifies a contract combinator for the interface, which I’ll describe later in the article.</p>\n\n<p>We now have the generic functions, but they’re not very useful without concrete implementations. To implement a generic interface, you first need to define a structure type. We’ll define a simple functional queue(Okasaki 1998, p.42) that uses two lists:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define-struct.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._struct))\" style=\"color: inherit\">struct</a></span> <span class=\"n\">simple-queue</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">front</span> <span class=\"n\">back</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">#:methods</span> <span class=\"n\">gen:queue</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"c1\">;

Any queues created with that constructor will be checked for integers.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you might have noticed that the queues we wrote above don’t protect against dequeueing or taking the head of empty queues. To prevent this, we can write contracts that ensure these operations raise contract errors on empty queues.

In fact, the nice thing about <code>syntax-rules</code> is that you write more or less the specification of your transformation.

There is no problem in accommodating two languages with two different <code>if</code>&rsquo;s: the new form is compiled to the old one, and there is no confusion in which version you use in any module.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the macro issue: as I said above, you run into problems if you want to capture names, right? For example, if you want to implement Arc&rsquo;s <code>aif</code>. The usual <code>syntax-case</code> solution is to construct an identifier that has the lexical context of the input syntax. It&rsquo;s easy to abstract over all this &mdash; I posted a <a href=\"http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=841\">message</a> on the Arc forum showing how to define a <a href=\"http://tmp.barzilay.org/defmac.ss\">defmac</a> macro that has the simplicity of <code>syntax-rules</code> with the added convenience of specifying keywords and captured names. This works for <em>some</em> cases, but there are still some <a href=\"http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/372/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-12.html#node_sec_12.2.1.1\">subtle corner cases</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a better solution in PLT Scheme, one that follows Paul Graham&rsquo;s intuition when he <a href=\"http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=2526\">says</a>: &ldquo;captured symbols are kind of freaky.&rdquo; The basic idea is a change of perspective: instead of (unhygienically) binding individual occurrences of <code>it</code> whenever <code>aif</code> is used, you define <code>it</code> once as a thing in its own right &mdash; a special context-dependent piece of syntax. Outside of an <code>aif</code> form, <code>it</code> has no meaning: we simply make it throw a syntax error. Uses of <code>aif</code> provide a meaning for <code>it</code> by locally changing its meaning (its expansion) to something useful: the binding that holds the result of evaluating the condition expression. (&ldquo;Locally&rdquo; means within a piece of syntax, so the new meaning is valid in a lexical-scope.)</p>\n\n<p>In PLT Scheme, the &ldquo;special context-dependent piece of syntax&rdquo; are <em>syntax parameters</em>, and you change them locally with <code>syntax-parameterize</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To continue the above example, here&rsquo;s how we make our <code>if*</code> anaphoric:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>require the <code>(lib \"stxparam.ss\" \"mzlib\")</code> library,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>define <code>it</code> as a syntax using <code>define-syntax-parameter</code>, and have it raise an error by default,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>bind a temporary variable to the result of evaluating the condition,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>wrap the positive branch with <code>syntax-parameterize</code>, using <code>make-rename-transformer</code>, which is a convenient way to make a macro that behaves like the new variable.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>The implementation looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a

Compare this to the specification of Arc&rsquo;s <code>if</code>, which appears in a comment before the definition of <code>ac-if</code> in \"<code>ac.scm</code>\":</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  <span class=\"c1\">; (if) -&gt; nil</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">; (if x) -&gt; x</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">; (if t a ...) -&gt; a</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">; (if nil a b) -&gt; b</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">; (if nil a b c) -&gt; (if b c)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>(Except that the comment mixes up the syntactic specification and the semantic evaluation.)</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, now that we have this definition, it is easy to construct a new language that is just like MzScheme, except for its <code>if</code> that behaves like the above:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/module.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._module))\" style=\"color: inherit\">module</a></span> <span class=\"n\">arc-like</span> <span class=\"n\">mzscheme</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define-syntax))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define-syntax</a></span> <span class=\"n\">if*</span> <span class=\"n\">..._the</span> <span class=\"n\">above</span> <span class=\"n\">definition_...</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/require.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._provide))\" style=\"color: inherit\">provide</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">all-from-except</span> <span class=\"n\">mzscheme</span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._if))\" style=\"color: inherit\">if</a></span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n             <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/creatingunits.html#(form._((lib._racket/unit..rkt)._rename))\" style=\"color: inherit\">rename</a></span> <span class=\"n\">if*</span> <span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._if))\" style=\"color: inherit\">if</a></span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>You can now write code that uses <code>\"arc-like.scm\"</code> as its language, using the new <code>if</code>. There is no problem in accommodating two languages with two different <code>if</code>&rsquo;s: the new form is compiled to the old one, and there is no confusion in which version you use in any module.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the macro issue: as I said above, you run into problems if you want to capture names, right? For example, if you want to implement Arc&rsquo;s <code>aif</code>. The usual <code>syntax-case</code> solution is to construct an identifier that has the lexical context of the input syntax. It&rsquo;s easy to abstract over all this &mdash; I posted a <a href=\"http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=841\">message</a> on the Arc forum showing how to define a <a href=\"http://tmp.barzilay.org/defmac.ss\">defmac</a> macro that has the simplicity of <code>syntax-rules</code> with the added convenience of specifying keywords and captured names. This works for <em>some</em> cases, but there are still some <a href=\"http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/372/html/mzscheme/mzscheme-Z-H-12.html#node_sec_12.2.1.1\">subtle corner cases</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a better solution in PLT Scheme, one that follows Paul Graham&rsquo;s intuition when he <a href=\"http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=2526\">says</a>: &ldquo;captured symbols are kind of freaky.&rdquo; The basic idea is a change of perspective: instead of (unhygienically) binding individual occurrences of <code>it</code> whenever <code>aif</code> is used, you define <code>it</code> once as a thing in its own right &mdash; a special context-dependent piece of syntax. Outside of an <code>aif</code> form, <code>it</code> has no meaning: we simply make it throw a syntax error. Uses of <code>aif</code> provide a meaning for <code>it</code> by locally changing its meaning (its expansion) to something useful: the binding that holds the result of evaluating the condition expression. (&ldquo;Locally&rdquo; means within a piece of syntax, so the new meaning is valid in a lexical-scope.)</p>\n\n<p>In PLT Scheme, the &ldquo;special context-dependent piece of syntax&rdquo; are <em>syntax parameters</em>, and you change them locally with <code>syntax-parameterize</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To continue the above example, here&rsquo;s how we make our <code>if*</code> anaphoric:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>require the <code>(lib \"stxparam.ss\" \"mzlib\")</code> library,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>define <code>it</code> as a syntax using <code>define-syntax-parameter</code>, and have it raise an error by default,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>bind a temporary variable to the result of evaluating the condition,</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>wrap the positive branch with <code>syntax-parameterize</code>, using <code>make-rename-transformer</code>, which is a convenient way to make a macro that behaves like the new variable.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>The implementation looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a

Before you read on, you should stop and ask yourself: <em>Do I think these two are the same concept?</em>; if you think they are different, <em>How do I think they differ?</em>; and for that matter, <em>Do I even think of them as related?</em></p>\n\n<p>Did you think? Okay, then read on.</p>\n\n<p>They most certainly are related, because they are both mechanisms for optimizing a computation by replacing repeated sub-computations with the storage and reuse of the result of those sub-computations. (That is, both trade off space for time.) In that description is already implicit an assumption: that the sub-computation will return the same result every time (or else you can&rsquo;t replace the computation with its value on subsequent invocations). You&rsquo;ve almost certainly heard of DP from an algorithms class. You&rsquo;ve probably heard of memoization if you&rsquo;re a member of this language&rsquo;s community, but many undergrads simply never see it because algorithms textbooks ignore it; and when they do mention it they demonstrate fundamental misunderstandings (as Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani does).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, let&rsquo;s set aside precedent. I&rsquo;ll tell you how to think about them.</p>\n\n<p>Memoization is fundamentally a top-down computation and DP is fundamentally bottom-up. In memoization, we observe that a computational <em>tree</em> can actually be represented as a computational <em>DAG</em> (a directed acyclic graph: the single most underrated data structure in computer science); we then use a black-box to turn the tree into a DAG. But it allows the top-down description of the problem to remain unchanged. (As I left unstated originally but commenter23 below rightly intuited, the nodes are function calls, edges are call dependencies, and the arrows are directed from caller to callee. See the pictures later in this article.)</p>\n\n<p>In DP, we make the same observation, but construct the DAG from the bottom-up. That means we have to rewrite the computation to express the delta from each computational tree/DAG node to its parents. We also need a means for addressing/naming those parents (which we did not need in the top-down case, since this was implicit in the recursive call stack). This leads to inventions like DP tables, but people often fail to understand why they exist: it&rsquo;s primarily as a <em>naming mechanism</em> (and while we&rsquo;re at it, why not make it efficient to find a named element, ergo arrays and matrices).</p>\n\n<p>In both cases, there is the potential for space wastage. In memoization, it is very difficult to get rid of this waste (you could have custom, space-saving memoizers, as Vclav Pech points out in his comment below, but then the programmer risks using the wrong one&hellip;which to me destroys the beauty of memoization in the first place). In contrast, in DP it&rsquo;s easier to save space because you can just look at the delta function to see how far &ldquo;back&rdquo; it reaches; beyond there lies garbage, and you can come up with a cleverer representation that stores just the relevant part (the &ldquo;fringe&rdquo;). Once you understand this, you realize that the classic textbook linear, iterative computation of the fibonacci is just an extreme example of DP, where the entire &ldquo;table&rdquo; has been reduced to two iteration variables. (Did your algorithms textbook tell you that?)</p>\n\n<p>In my class, we work through some of the canonical DP algorithms as memoization problems instead, just so when students later encounter these as &ldquo;DP problems&rdquo; in algorithms classes, they (a) realize there is nothing canonical about this presentation, and (b) can be wise-asses about it.</p>\n\n<p>There are many trade-offs between memoization and DP that should drive the choice of which one to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Memoization</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>leaves computational description unchanged (black-box)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>avoids unnecessary sub-computations (i.e., saves time, and some space with it)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>hard to save space absent a strategy for what sub-computations to dispose of</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>must alway check whether a sub-computation has already been done before doing it (which incurs a small cost)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has a time complexity that depends on picking a smart computation name lookup strategy In direct contrast, <strong>DP</strong>:</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>forces change in desription of the algorithm, which may introduce errors and certainly introduces some maintenance overhead</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>cannot avoid unnecessary sub-computations (and may waste the space associated with storing those results)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>can more easily save space by disposing of unnecessary sub-computation results</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has no need to check whether a computation has been done before doing it&mdash;the computation is rewritten to ensure this isn&rsquo;t necessary</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has a space complexity that depends on picking a smart data storage strategy [NB: Small edits to the above list thanks to an exchange with Prabhakar Ragde.]</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>I therefore tell my students: first write the computation and observe whether it fits the DAG pattern; if it does, use memoization. Only if the space proves to be a problem and a specialized memo strategy won&rsquo;t help&mdash;or, even less likely, the cost of &ldquo;has it already been computed&rdquo; is also a problem&mdash;should you think about converting to DP. And when you do, do so in a methodical way, retaining structural similarity to the original. Every subsequent programmer who has to maintain your code will thank you.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll end with a short quiz that I always pose to my class.</p>\n\n<p>Memoization is an optimization of a top-down, depth-first computation for an answer. DP is an optimization of a bottom-up, breadth-first computation for an answer. We should naturally ask, what about</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>top-down, breadth-first</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>bottom-up, depth-first Where do they fit into the space of techniques for avoiding recomputation by trading off space for time?</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Do we already have names for them? If so, what?, or</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Have we been missing one or two important tricks?, or</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Is there a reason we don&rsquo;t have names for these?</p></li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"wheres-the-code\">Where&rsquo;s the Code?</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been criticized for not including code, which is a fair complaint.

Okay, then read on.</p>\n\n<p>They most certainly are related, because they are both mechanisms for optimizing a computation by replacing repeated sub-computations with the storage and reuse of the result of those sub-computations. (That is, both trade off space for time.) In that description is already implicit an assumption: that the sub-computation will return the same result every time (or else you can&rsquo;t replace the computation with its value on subsequent invocations). You&rsquo;ve almost certainly heard of DP from an algorithms class. You&rsquo;ve probably heard of memoization if you&rsquo;re a member of this language&rsquo;s community, but many undergrads simply never see it because algorithms textbooks ignore it; and when they do mention it they demonstrate fundamental misunderstandings (as Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani does).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, let&rsquo;s set aside precedent. I&rsquo;ll tell you how to think about them.</p>\n\n<p>Memoization is fundamentally a top-down computation and DP is fundamentally bottom-up. In memoization, we observe that a computational <em>tree</em> can actually be represented as a computational <em>DAG</em> (a directed acyclic graph: the single most underrated data structure in computer science); we then use a black-box to turn the tree into a DAG. But it allows the top-down description of the problem to remain unchanged. (As I left unstated originally but commenter23 below rightly intuited, the nodes are function calls, edges are call dependencies, and the arrows are directed from caller to callee. See the pictures later in this article.)</p>\n\n<p>In DP, we make the same observation, but construct the DAG from the bottom-up. That means we have to rewrite the computation to express the delta from each computational tree/DAG node to its parents. We also need a means for addressing/naming those parents (which we did not need in the top-down case, since this was implicit in the recursive call stack). This leads to inventions like DP tables, but people often fail to understand why they exist: it&rsquo;s primarily as a <em>naming mechanism</em> (and while we&rsquo;re at it, why not make it efficient to find a named element, ergo arrays and matrices).</p>\n\n<p>In both cases, there is the potential for space wastage. In memoization, it is very difficult to get rid of this waste (you could have custom, space-saving memoizers, as Vclav Pech points out in his comment below, but then the programmer risks using the wrong one&hellip;which to me destroys the beauty of memoization in the first place). In contrast, in DP it&rsquo;s easier to save space because you can just look at the delta function to see how far &ldquo;back&rdquo; it reaches; beyond there lies garbage, and you can come up with a cleverer representation that stores just the relevant part (the &ldquo;fringe&rdquo;). Once you understand this, you realize that the classic textbook linear, iterative computation of the fibonacci is just an extreme example of DP, where the entire &ldquo;table&rdquo; has been reduced to two iteration variables. (Did your algorithms textbook tell you that?)</p>\n\n<p>In my class, we work through some of the canonical DP algorithms as memoization problems instead, just so when students later encounter these as &ldquo;DP problems&rdquo; in algorithms classes, they (a) realize there is nothing canonical about this presentation, and (b) can be wise-asses about it.</p>\n\n<p>There are many trade-offs between memoization and DP that should drive the choice of which one to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Memoization</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>leaves computational description unchanged (black-box)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>avoids unnecessary sub-computations (i.e., saves time, and some space with it)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>hard to save space absent a strategy for what sub-computations to dispose of</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>must alway check whether a sub-computation has already been done before doing it (which incurs a small cost)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has a time complexity that depends on picking a smart computation name lookup strategy In direct contrast, <strong>DP</strong>:</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>forces change in desription of the algorithm, which may introduce errors and certainly introduces some maintenance overhead</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>cannot avoid unnecessary sub-computations (and may waste the space associated with storing those results)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>can more easily save space by disposing of unnecessary sub-computation results</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has no need to check whether a computation has been done before doing it&mdash;the computation is rewritten to ensure this isn&rsquo;t necessary</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>has a space complexity that depends on picking a smart data storage strategy [NB: Small edits to the above list thanks to an exchange with Prabhakar Ragde.]</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>I therefore tell my students: first write the computation and observe whether it fits the DAG pattern; if it does, use memoization. Only if the space proves to be a problem and a specialized memo strategy won&rsquo;t help&mdash;or, even less likely, the cost of &ldquo;has it already been computed&rdquo; is also a problem&mdash;should you think about converting to DP. And when you do, do so in a methodical way, retaining structural similarity to the original. Every subsequent programmer who has to maintain your code will thank you.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll end with a short quiz that I always pose to my class.</p>\n\n<p>Memoization is an optimization of a top-down, depth-first computation for an answer. DP is an optimization of a bottom-up, breadth-first computation for an answer. We should naturally ask, what about</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>top-down, breadth-first</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>bottom-up, depth-first Where do they fit into the space of techniques for avoiding recomputation by trading off space for time?</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Do we already have names for them? If so, what?, or</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Have we been missing one or two important tricks?, or</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Is there a reason we don&rsquo;t have names for these?</p></li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"wheres-the-code\">Where&rsquo;s the Code?</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been criticized for not including code, which is a fair complaint.

Pitchers!</h2>\n\n<p>The easiest way to illustrate the tree-to-DAG conversion visually is via the Fibonacci computation. Here&rsquo;s a picture of the computational tree:</p>\n\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s see it with memoization. The calls are still the same, but the dashed ovals are the ones that don&rsquo;t compute but whose values are instead looked up, and their emergent arrows show which computation&rsquo;s value was returned by the memoizer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: The above example is misleading because it suggests that memoization <em>linearizes</em> the computation, which in general it does not. If you want to truly understand the process, I suggest hand-tracing the Levenshtein computation with memoization. And to truly understand the <em>relationship</em> to DP, compare that hand-traced Levenshtein computation with the DP version. (Hint: you can save some manual tracing effort by lightly instrumenting your memoizer to print inputs and outputs. Also, make the memo table a global variable so you can observe it grow.)</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Nice teaser blog, but dry. Where is the code to explain such broad statements?</p>\n\n<p>It sounds as if you have a point - Enough to make me want to see examples but there is nothing beneath to chew on.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Paddy3118, 26 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thank you for such a nice generalization of the concept. I elaborated on a specific task in one of my earlier posts (http://www.jroller.com/vaclav/entry/memoize_groovy_functions_with_gpars), where by simply adding memoization on top of a recursive Fibonacci function I end-up with linear time complexity. Since Groovy supports space-limited variants of memoize, getting down to constant space complexity (exactly two values) was easily achievable, too.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Václav Pech, 26 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>@Paddy3118: The simplest example I can think of is the Fibonacci sequence. The implementations in Javascript can be as follows.  function FIB_MEMO(num) {  var cache = { 1: 1, 2: 1 };  function innerFib(x) {  if(cache[x]) { return cache[x]; }  cache[x] = (innerFib(x&ndash;1) + innerFib(x&ndash;2));  return cache[x];  }  return innerFib(num); } function FIB_DP(num) {  var a = 1, b = 1, i = 3, tmp;  while(i &lt;= num) {  tmp = a;  a = b;  b = tmp + b;  i++;  }  return b; } It can be seen that the Memoization version &ldquo;leaves computational description unchanged&rdquo;. And the DP version &ldquo;forces change in desription of the algorithm&rdquo;. Also note that the Memoization version can take a lot of stack space if you try to call the function with a large number. The trade-offs mentioned at the end of the article can easily be seen in these implementations.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>simil, 26 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A small note from someone who was initially confused - it was hard to parse what you meant by converting a DAG into a tree as the article didn&rsquo;t mention what the nodes and edges signify. Presumably the nodes are function calls and edges indicate one call needing another. And the direction of the arrows point from the caller to the callee? It would be more clear if this was mentioned before the DAG to tree statement.  Nevertheless, a good article.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>commenter23, 26 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Inserting the line &ldquo;memoize&rdquo; may work beautifully, but it doesn&rsquo;t really illuminate what&rsquo;s going on. Would there be any point adding a version that expands that into explicitly checking and updating a table?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>sbloch, 27 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>1) I completely agree that pedagogically it&rsquo;s much better to teach memoization first before dynamic programming. The latter has <em>two</em> stumbling blocks for students: one the very idea of decomposing of a problem in terms of similar sub-problems, and the other the idea of filling up a table bottom-up, and it&rsquo;s best to introduce them one-by-one. Then you can say &ldquo;dynamic programming is doing the memoization bottom-up&rdquo;. As an aside, for students who know mathematical induction, it sometimes helps them to say &ldquo;dynamic programming is somewhat like induction&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>2) What are the fundamental misunderstandings in the Algorithms book? (I haven&rsquo;t seen it.)</p>\n\n<p>3) One issue with memoization that you didn&rsquo;t mention is stack overflow. Because of its depth-first nature, solving a problem for N can result in a stack depth of nearly N (even worse for problems where answers are to be computed for multiple dimensions like (M,N)); this can be an issue when stack size is small.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>shreevatsa, 28 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Stephen (sbloch), sorry, but no time to do that right now. You&rsquo;re right that that would help, but I was assuming the reader had some knowledge of memoization to begin with, or could look it up.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shriram Krishnamurthi, 29 August 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>shreevatsa, +1 to everything you said.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t locate the comment in <em>Algorithms</em> right now, but it was basically deprecating memoization by writing not particularly enlightened remarks about &ldquo;recursion&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>One slight counter to your comment #2: if depth of recursion really is a problem, one could systematically eliminate it using techniques like CPS. Thus the solution can still be expressed as base functionality + functional abstractions + program transformations.

Here&rsquo;s a Racket memoize that should work for any number of args on the memoized function:</p>\n\n<p>(define (memoize f)   (local ([define table (make-hash)])     (lambda args       ;; Look up the arguments.       ;; If they&rsquo;re present, just give back the stored result.       ;; If they&rsquo;re not present, calculate and store the result.       ;; Note that the calculation will not be expensive as long        ;; as f uses this memoized version for its recursive call,        ;; which is the natural way to write it!       (dict-ref! table args                  (lambda ()                    (apply f args))))))</p>\n\n<p>— <em>wolf, 19 September 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>@wolf, nice, thanks. Keep in mind that different uses might want different kinds of equality comparisons (equal? vs eq?, say). May be good to remind your class of that. They could generalize your memoize to be parameterized over that (even in each position, if they want to go wild).</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shriram Krishnamurthi, 19 September 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Got here from your parsing G+ post.</p>\n\n<p>You are unfair towards Algorithms. The statement they make is: &ldquo;However, the constant factor in this big-O notation is substantially larger because of the overhead of recursion.&rdquo; That was true of hardware from more than 20 years ago; It&rsquo;s not true today, as far as I know. Although you can make the case that with DP it&rsquo;s easier to control cache locality, and cache locality still matters, a lot.</p>\n\n<p>If you view these remarks as trying to say something about what memoization is, then they are wrong. But, they aren&rsquo;t supposed to be remarks about what memoization is. They are simply practical considerations that are related to memoization.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine someone says: &ldquo;DFS might be more appropriate than BFS in this case, because space might be an issue; but be careful &mdash; most hardware takes a lot longer to execute a &lsquo;call&rsquo; as compared to a &lsquo;jmp&rsquo;.&rdquo; Is this statement a mis-informed indictment of DFS? Not really. You can do DFS without calls. For that matter, you can do memoization without &rsquo;call&rsquo;s. (Oh, wait, you already mentioned CPS. :) )</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Radu Grigore, 2 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Radu, okay, my remark may be a bit too harsh. Sure. But I can throw in other criticisms too: the fact that it appears so late in the book, only as a sidebar, and is then called a &ldquo;trick&rdquo;, as if the DP version of the algorithm were somehow fundamental! Of course, the next criticism would be, &ldquo;Hey, they at least mentioned it &mdash; most algorithms textbooks don&rsquo;t do even that!&rdquo; So at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all just damning with faint praise.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shriram Krishnamurthi, 2 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Also, Radu, I&rsquo;m curious why it&rsquo;s fine for a book written in 2006 to say things you believe were out of date for at least 13 years at that point. (-:</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shriram Krishnamurthi, 2 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The statement they make about constant factors is about how hardware works, not about a fundamental issue. This is my point.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll try to show you why your criticism is unfair, by temporarily putting you at the other end of a similar line of attack. So, please indulge me, and don&rsquo;t get too annoyed.</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; start &mdash;</p>\n\n<p>Your omission of cache locality from the comparison demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. OK maybe that is a bit too harsh. However, it does show that you haven&rsquo;t actually benchmarked your levenshtein implementation against a DP version that keeps only the fringe, so you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the difference in performance. But, how could anyone believe that not knowing this is OK?</p>\n\n<p>&mdash; stop &mdash;</p>\n\n<p>I believe that the above criticism of your post is unfair, and similar to your criticism of the book.</p>\n\n<p>The book is a small jewel, with emphasis on small. It is packed with cool tricks (where &ldquo;trick&rdquo; is to be understood as something good). Too bad they wrote that book after I learned those tricks the tedious way.</p>\n\n<p>Your post is pretty good too. I especially liked the quiz at the end.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Radu Grigore, 3 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Shriram: I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether they are right about the &ldquo;overhead of recursion&rdquo;. I thought they are wrong, but I did some experiments and it seems they are right-ish: http://rgrig.blogspot.com/2013/12/edit-distance-benchmarks.html</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Radu Grigore, 11 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thanks. I did some experiments with using the same data structure in both cases, and I got a slight gain from the memoized version.</p>\n\n<p>Note that my DP version uses an option type to prevent accidental use of an uninitialized slot, because if you truly want to compare the two, you should make sure you have the same safety characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Remove that and I believe the DP version is indeed a bit faster, but now you&rsquo;re comparing a safe and unsafe implementation of a problem. That&rsquo;s not a fair comparison and the difference can&rsquo;t be attributed entirely to the calling mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Also, whether or not you use a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; DP, in the memoized version you also have to check for whether the problem has already been solved. How do you know that the overhead you&rsquo;re seeing is entirely due to recursion, and not due to this?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Shriram Krishnamurthi, 12 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I will have to disagree with what you call a fair comparison. But I want to use as a starting point a statement on which we probably agree: Memoization is more clear, more elegant, and safer.</p>\n\n<p>But things like memoization and dynamic programming do not live in a totally ordered universe. There are multiple dimensions across which they can be compared, such as correctness and efficiency. Clarity, elegance and safety all have to do with correctness.</p>\n\n<p>When you say that it isn&rsquo;t fair to implement dp without options, that sounds to me like saying it isn&rsquo;t fair to compare a program with an optimized version of itself. For example, like saying that comparing a program with array bounds checks against the version without bounds checks isn&rsquo;t fair. And I can&rsquo;t agree with this.</p>\n\n<p>What wouldn&rsquo;t be fair would be to not acknowledge that there is a trade-off involved: you gain efficiency, but you lose safety. The latter means that the programmer needs to do more work to achieve correctness. And yes, almost always this is a bad trade-off.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, comparing memoization with a patched up version of dp that tries to recover some safety looks very odd to me.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe the DP version is indeed a bit faster&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>If by &ldquo;a bit faster&rdquo; you mean &ldquo;about twice as fast&rdquo;, then I agree. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m tempted to ask to see your code. :)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;How do you know that the overhead you&rsquo;re seeing is entirely due to recursion, and not due to [checking whether a result is already available]?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I could add the checking overhead to dp and see how big it is. But why would I? The number you really care about when comparing efficiency is the overall time.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Radu Grigore, 19 December 2013</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 34) f post (u .

"\n<p><em>posted by Eli Barzilay</em></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is not really a tutorial on macros, it&rsquo;s more of a quick introduction to using Racket&rsquo;s <code>syntax-case</code>-based macros for people who are familiar with symbolic macros and miss their “simplicity”. It&rsquo;s also not comprehensive or thorough or complete, it&rsquo;s just intended to provide a rough quick overview of how to write macros. It was originally posted on comp.lang.scheme in a thread called “Idiot&rsquo;s guide to Scheme macros”, but I avoided that title here, since it&rsquo;s not a general purpose guide. (Also, it&rsquo;s yet another attempt to dispel the irrational “macrophobia” some people have when it gets to hygienic macros, leading them back to using <code>defmacro</code> with all its problems.)</p>\n\n<p>The main idea with Racket&rsquo;s macro system (and with other <code>syntax-case</code> systems) is that macros are syntax-to-syntax functions, just like the case of <code>defmacro</code>, except that instead of raw S-expressions you&rsquo;re dealing with syntax objects. This becomes very noticeable when identifiers are handled: instead of dealing with plain symbols, you&rsquo;re dealing with these syntax values (called “identifiers” in this case) that are essentially a symbol and <em>some opaque information</em> that represents the lexical scope for its source. In several <code>syntax-case</code> systems this is the only difference from <code>defmacro</code> macros, but in the Racket case this applies to everything — identifiers, numbers, other immediate constants, and even function applications, etc — they are all the same S-expression values that you&rsquo;re used to, except wrapped with additional information. Another thing that is unique to Racket is the extra information: in addition to the opaque lexical context, there is also source information and arbitrary properties (there are also certificates, but that&rsquo;s ignorable for this text).</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, explaining the rest is not too difficult:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-source stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-position stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-line stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-column stx)</code> — retrieve parts of the source location information.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-e stx)</code> — takes a syntax value and returns the value it “wraps”. For example, if <code>stx</code> is an identifier you&rsquo;d get a symbol, and if it&rsquo;s a number you&rsquo;d get the number. If it&rsquo;s a simple parenthesized form, you&rsquo;d get a list of syntax values for the subforms. Note that the list can be improper, with the last element being a syntax object that contains a proper list. (But the list will actually be improper if the original syntax was a dotted list.)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-&gt;datum stx)</code> — takes a syntax value and returns the plain S-expression that it holds. This is done by recursive uses of <code>syntax-e</code>. (It would be a simple definition that does what you&rsquo;d think it should do.)</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-&gt;list stx)</code> — sometimes you want to pull out the list of syntax values from a given parenthesized syntax, but <code>syntax-e</code> does too little (can still return an improper list) and <code>syntax-&gt;datum</code> does too much (gives you back raw S-expressions). <code>syntax-&gt;list</code> is a utility function that uses <code>syntax-e</code> as many times as needed to get back a proper list of syntax values. If that&rsquo;s not possible (if the input syntax was not a proper list), it returns <code>#f</code>, so it serves as a predicate too.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-property stx prop)</code> — returns the given property value from stx, if any, and <code>#f</code> if none. For example, try</p></li></ul>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stxprops.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._syntax-property))\" style=\"color: inherit\">syntax-property</a></span> <span class=\"o\">#'</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">paren-shape</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>(The <code>#'</code> is similar to a quote, but for syntax values — I&rsquo;ll get to that later on.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Note that there is <em>no</em> accessor for the opaque lexical scope, and as you&rsquo;ll see next, you don&rsquo;t need one.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>To create a piece of syntax you use <code>datum-&gt;syntax</code>, and you give it an S-expression which will be the “contents” of the resulting syntax object.

The second line is the pattern that is matched against this input — with two pattern variables that match the second subexpression and the sequence of expressions from the third and on. (The first subexpression is matched against <code>_</code> which is a wild-card that matches anything without binding a pattern variable — the head part is often not needed, since it&rsquo;s just the macro name.) The last line is the output, specified using <code>syntax</code>, which means that it&rsquo;s very similar to the previous version where everything is given the lexical context of the macro and the two pattern variables are replaced with the two matches (so <code>body</code> gets spliced into the resulting syntax).</p>\n\n<p>Now, say that you want an unhygienic user-visible piece of syntax.

Each of these choices has subtle differences that are especially important when you&rsquo;re composing macros (for example, using a second macro that <em>expands</em> to a <code>while</code>, where the test expression comes from that macro rather than the user code). Demonstrating these things is a popular way to pass the time in some circles, but I&rsquo;ll avoid it here. In fact, a great way to avoid this whole thing altogether is not create unhygienic bindings in the first place. It sounds like doing so excludes cases where you <em>really</em> want to have a new binding visible in user code, but Racket provides “syntax parameters” that can be used more conveniently (and less confusingly) — see <a href=\"../../2008/02/dirty-looking-hygiene.html\">an earlier post</a> for a description of that. As a side note, these options are a good hint that a hygienic macro system is more expressive than a symbolic <code>defmacro</code> system, where no such choices exist. Creating such macros using <code>defmacro</code> can appear easier simply because of this lack of choice — in the same way that CPP-style string-based macros are “simpler” than <code>defmacro</code> since they&rsquo;re less expressive (just appending lexical tokens, no structural information).</p>\n\n<p> There are other important aspects of the Racket macro system that are not covered here. The most obvious of them is worth mentioning here: Racket separates the “runtime phase” from the “syntax phase”. For example, if you want to try these examples with “<code>#lang racket/base</code>”, you&rsquo;ll need to add <code>(require (for-syntax racket/base))</code> since the <code>racket/base</code> language doesn&rsquo;t have a full language in its syntax phase.</p>\n\n<p> Roughly speaking, this makes sure that source code is deterministically compilable by having each level live in its own world, limiting macros to deal only with the input syntax only and not runtime values. (For example, a CLOS implementation in this system cannot check the value of an identifier bound to a class to determine how some macro should expand.) This results in reliable compilations that do not depend on how things were loaded, or whatever happened on the REPL.</p>\n\n<p> The important bottom line here is that you get to write macros with the full language available — and phase separation means that Racket is explicitly designed to make running code at the macro level and using it by the compiler as robust as possible, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about using any complex system as part of your macro. You just need to keep in mind that the macro world is completely separate from the runtime, and the direct benefit of not worrying about weird interactions with compilation and file loading orders.</p>") #f (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Eli Barzilay</em></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: This is not really a tutorial on macros, it&rsquo;s more of a quick introduction to using Racket&rsquo;s <code>syntax-case</code>-based macros for people who are familiar with symbolic macros and miss their “simplicity”. It&rsquo;s also not comprehensive or thorough or complete, it&rsquo;s just intended to provide a rough quick overview of how to write macros. It was originally posted on comp.lang.scheme in a thread called “Idiot&rsquo;s guide to Scheme macros”, but I avoided that title here, since it&rsquo;s not a general purpose guide. (Also, it&rsquo;s yet another attempt to dispel the irrational “macrophobia” some people have when it gets to hygienic macros, leading them back to using <code>defmacro</code> with all its problems.)</p>\n\n<p>The main idea with Racket&rsquo;s macro system (and with other <code>syntax-case</code> systems) is that macros are syntax-to-syntax functions, just like the case of <code>defmacro</code>, except that instead of raw S-expressions you&rsquo;re dealing with syntax objects. This becomes very noticeable when identifiers are handled: instead of dealing with plain symbols, you&rsquo;re dealing with these syntax values (called “identifiers” in this case) that are essentially a symbol and <em>some opaque information</em> that represents the lexical scope for its source. In several <code>syntax-case</code> systems this is the only difference from <code>defmacro</code> macros, but in the Racket case this applies to everything — identifiers, numbers, other immediate constants, and even function applications, etc — they are all the same S-expression values that you&rsquo;re used to, except wrapped with additional information. Another thing that is unique to Racket is the extra information: in addition to the opaque lexical context, there is also source information and arbitrary properties (there are also certificates, but that&rsquo;s ignorable for this text).</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, explaining the rest is not too difficult:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-source stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-position stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-line stx)</code>, <code>(syntax-column stx)</code> — retrieve parts of the source location information.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p><code>(syntax-e stx)</code> — takes a syntax value and returns the value it “wraps”. For example, if <code>stx</code> is an identifier you&rsquo;d get a symbol, and if it&rsquo;s a number you&rsquo;d get the number. If it&rsquo;s a simple parenthesized form, you&rsquo;d get a list of syntax values for the subforms. Note that the list can be improper, with the last element being a syntax object that contains a proper list.

Each of these choices has subtle differences that are especially important when you&rsquo;re composing macros (for example, using a second macro that <em>expands</em> to a <code>while</code>, where the test expression comes from that macro rather than the user code). Demonstrating these things is a popular way to pass the time in some circles, but I&rsquo;ll avoid it here. In fact, a great way to avoid this whole thing altogether is not create unhygienic bindings in the first place. It sounds like doing so excludes cases where you <em>really</em> want to have a new binding visible in user code, but Racket provides “syntax parameters” that can be used more conveniently (and less confusingly) — see <a href=\"../../2008/02/dirty-looking-hygiene.html\">an earlier post</a> for a description of that. As a side note, these options are a good hint that a hygienic macro system is more expressive than a symbolic <code>defmacro</code> system, where no such choices exist. Creating such macros using <code>defmacro</code> can appear easier simply because of this lack of choice — in the same way that CPP-style string-based macros are “simpler” than <code>defmacro</code> since they&rsquo;re less expressive (just appending lexical tokens, no structural information).</p>\n\n<p> There are other important aspects of the Racket macro system that are not covered here. The most obvious of them is worth mentioning here: Racket separates the “runtime phase” from the “syntax phase”. For example, if you want to try these examples with “<code>#lang racket/base</code>”, you&rsquo;ll need to add <code>(require (for-syntax racket/base))</code> since the <code>racket/base</code> language doesn&rsquo;t have a full language in its syntax phase.</p>\n\n<p> Roughly speaking, this makes sure that source code is deterministically compilable by having each level live in its own world, limiting macros to deal only with the input syntax only and not runtime values. (For example, a CLOS implementation in this system cannot check the value of an identifier bound to a class to determine how some macro should expand.) This results in reliable compilations that do not depend on how things were loaded, or whatever happened on the REPL.</p>\n\n<p> The important bottom line here is that you get to write macros with the full language available — and phase separation means that Racket is explicitly designed to make running code at the macro level and using it by the compiler as robust as possible, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about using any complex system as part of your macro. You just need to keep in mind that the macro world is completely separate from the runtime, and the direct benefit of not worrying about weird interactions with compilation and file loading orders.</p>")) ((? . 118) f post (u .

In contrast, most Racket programmers writing programs that don&rsquo;t fit in a single file will end up working with packages and collections, whether they realize it or not.</p>\n\n<p>But to say a few words about them, units are first-class module-like values. Unlike Racket modules, they allow recursive linking, which allows for circular dependencies. They also allow dynamic linking, which makes it possible to &ldquo;swap in&rdquo; different implementations of the same signature. Dynamic linking also makes units useful for implementing plug-in systems, like the one in DrRacket, which can dynamically link in new plug-ins.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Vincent St-Amour, 13 August 2015</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thanks Vincent for an illuminating post. Regarding units, is it useful to think of modules as units with automatically generated signatures bounded together with the code?</p>\n\n<p>Modules cannot be recursively linked because they are values that are evaluated at compile/run time, while units can be because they can be represented by signature values that can be linked to arbitrary units satisfying the signatures. Is that a reasonable phrasing of the difference between modules and units?</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m curious, what are the disadvantages of organizing code using only units versus using modules?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Alexander McLin, 14 August 2015</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Alexander,</p>\n\n<p>The main thing modules and units have in common is that they are code containers that import and export names. Beyond that, the two systems are different enough that I don&rsquo;t think trying to understand one in terms of the other is helpful. Modules are static, while units are dynamic. Units are values, whereas modules are not. Modules interact nicely with macros, but units don&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the disadvantages of using units instead of modules are: * units do not support importing / exporting macros * linking errors happen at run-time instead of compile-time * units are syntactically more heavyweight * the dynamic nature of units prevents some optimizations That said, units are the right tool for some use cases, but modules are what you want most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Because units predate modules in Racket&rsquo;s history, there&rsquo;s a fair amount of code out there (including in the main distribution) that uses units in places where we&rsquo;d use modules today, e.g., parts of the net collection. That code is doing roughly what you&rsquo;re describing, so you may be interested in looking at the result. :)</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Vincent St-Amour, 16 August 2015</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thank you Vincent!</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Alexander McLin, 17 August 2015</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 84) f post (u .

"\n<p><em>posted by Asumu Takikawa</em></p>\n\n<p>About a month ago, inspired by a mailing list post by Tim Brown, Racketeers started to write more solutions to <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code\">Rosetta Code</a> tasks for Racket. Just today, we&rsquo;ve reached 200 entries in the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Racket\">Racket category</a>!</p>\n\n<p>This is a nice milestone, but we still have a ways to go. At 200 entries, Racket comes in at around 54th in the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/RC_POP.OUT\">popularity</a> rankings. So if you&rsquo;re looking to practice your Racketeering skills, don&rsquo;t hesitate to work on some of the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_Racket\">remaining tasks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a taste of the kinds of solutions we have so far, here are some examples.</p>\n\n<p>Mandelbrot:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n

"\n<p><em>posted by Asumu Takikawa</em></p>\n\n<p>About a month ago, inspired by a mailing list post by Tim Brown, Racketeers started to write more solutions to <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code\">Rosetta Code</a> tasks for Racket. Just today, we&rsquo;ve reached 200 entries in the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Racket\">Racket category</a>!</p>\n\n<p>This is a nice milestone, but we still have a ways to go. At 200 entries, Racket comes in at around 54th in the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/RC_POP.OUT\">popularity</a> rankings. So if you&rsquo;re looking to practice your Racketeering skills, don&rsquo;t hesitate to work on some of the <a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Reports:Tasks_not_implemented_in_Racket\">remaining tasks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a taste of the kinds of solutions we have so far, here are some examples.</p>\n\n<p>Mandelbrot:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n

But when I look at a few source fies of my own, I don&rsquo;t see a lot of xs.</p>\n\n<p>I do see a lot more quotes than I expected, though. So, I&rsquo;ll guess quote, though I think it&rsquo;s not a very good guess.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t think that car shows up much at all, actually. Maybe a few hundred times?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Matthew Flatt, 6 September 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>quote is not a bad guess. Its up there. x isn&rsquo;t bad either.

No, no, probably not. Okay, my best (bad) guess is &ldquo;list&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>John Clements, 6 September 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>let is pretty high but, surprisingly enough, if you add let*&rsquo;s numbers to let, then let does not move in the list! list is a bit lower.

Maybe 1% of identifiers, or so. I think with map/fold/etc. and pattern matching car is used quite infrequently.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Noel, 7 September 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought to count percentages. You&rsquo;re 1/2 right &hellip;. the top of the list is already in the 2% range!

<code>(line-of-interest)</code>. This number is then bound to line for use in building later syntax objects. Then the macro calls syntax-local-lift-expression with a syntax object that updates candidate-lines. Expressions passed to syntax-local-lift-expression are lifted to the top-level of the enclosing module making sure that, in this case, each line number is added exactly once without having to execute the code where <code>(line-of-interest)</code> appears. The macro then discards the result of syntax-local-lift-expression and returns a call to the visited function. That&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>\n\n<p>I originally used this macro to test some changes to DrRacket. I was working on a set of complex GUI interactions and kept losing track of which ones had been tested and which ones hadn&rsquo;t.

<code>(line-of-interest)</code>. This number is then bound to line for use in building later syntax objects. Then the macro calls syntax-local-lift-expression with a syntax object that updates candidate-lines. Expressions passed to syntax-local-lift-expression are lifted to the top-level of the enclosing module making sure that, in this case, each line number is added exactly once without having to execute the code where <code>(line-of-interest)</code> appears. The macro then discards the result of syntax-local-lift-expression and returns a call to the visited function. That&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>\n\n<p>I originally used this macro to test some changes to DrRacket. I was working on a set of complex GUI interactions and kept losing track of which ones had been tested and which ones hadn&rsquo;t.

A new quick start guide has been added to the documentation for the <code>syntax/parse</code> library.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Added support for abstract contracts via the #:exists keywords. This is an experiment to add support for data hiding to the contract system.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Added <code>in-producer</code>: a sequence expression makes it easy to iterate over producer functions (e.g., <code>read</code>).

"\n<p><em>posted by Eli Barzilay</em></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been one too many times that I hear respectable Schemers talk about how they like explicit renaming macros — not because they&rsquo;re more powerful, but because using them is close to using simple <code>defmacro</code>s. In this post I&rsquo;ll show how you can easily write ER-like macros in PLT, just so I won&rsquo;t need to explain the same thing once again.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in ER-macros, then you shouldn&rsquo;t read this.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>I&rsquo;m not claiming that ER macros are not respectable, I&rsquo;m just surprised at the knee jerk reaction to <code>syntax-case</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>This is not an attempt at providing some portable library or even a PLT library. The intention is to show that <code>syntax-case</code>-style macros are &ldquo;as convenient&rdquo; as ER macros, if you really want to get down to that level.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>This is also not an attempt at any kind of formal claim of equivalence in any direction, only a demonstration that you can get the same kind of convenience.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The bottom line here should be just the convenience point, addressed at people who like ER macros for that, and who think that <code>syntax-case</code> macros are somehow magical or that you lose the ability to play with S-expressions.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>The important fact here is that while PLT&rsquo;s <code>syntax-case</code> macro system does not give you raw S-expressions, what you get is a simple wrapper holding them. A macro is a syntax transformer: a function that consumes a syntax value and returns one. For example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define-syntax))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define-syntax</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"n\">stx</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">#'</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>is a macro that always expands to 123 (with <code>#'123</code> being the usual shorthand for <code>(syntax 123)</code>).</p>\n\n<p>A syntax object in PLT Scheme (the input to macro functions) is an S-expression, with some lexical information added — this includes the lexical context (in an opaque form), source location, and a few more things. To be more precise, a syntax value is a nested structure of wrappers holding lists and pairs, holding more wrappers, with identifiers at the leaves, where an identifier is a wrapper holding a symbol. It&rsquo;s easy to strip off all wrappers using <code>syntax-&gt;datum</code> if you like to work with S-expressions, but you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to strip it off of identifiers, since that will lose the important gravy. (In fact, the <code>defmacro</code> library works by stripping off all information, even from identifiers, then reconstructing it by trying to match names in the output form with the original input.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead of throwing away all information, what we want to do is preserve identifiers. We can use <code>syntax-&gt;list</code> for this: this is a function that takes a syntax value that contains a list, and strips off the top-level extra information leaving you with a list of syntaxes for the sub-expressions (returning <code>#f</code> if the input syntax does not hold a list). Once we have such a list, we can do the usual kind of processing with it, and when we&rsquo;re done turn the result back into a syntax using <code>datum-&gt;syntax</code> (which &ldquo;borrows&rdquo; the original input expression&rsquo;s information). For example,</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a

href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/larceny-users@lists.ccs.neu.edu/msg00097.html\">a post by Andre van Tonder</a> on the Larceny mailing list that uses a very similar approach and <em>does</em> make a library out of it. This is done by adding two arguments to the expected ER-transformation function — one is a <code>rename</code> function (since the above method uses <code>syntax</code> it is limited to immediate identifiers), and the other is always passed as <code>free-identifier=?</code>. Such a compatibility library is, however, not the purpose of this post.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is still a minor issue with this — PLT has an implicit <code>#%app</code> which is used wherever there are parentheses that stand for a function application — and in this code they are used unhygienically. This is usually not a noticeable problem, and if it is, you can add explicit <code>#%app</code>s. It might also be possible to find a more proper solution (e.g., use a hash table to keep track of lists that were disassembled by the client transformer), but at this point it might be better to just use the more natural <code>syntax-case</code> anyway.</p>") #t (u . "\n<p><em>posted by Eli Barzilay</em></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been one too many times that I hear respectable Schemers talk about how they like explicit renaming macros — not because they&rsquo;re more powerful, but because using them is close to using simple <code>defmacro</code>s. In this post I&rsquo;ll show how you can easily write ER-like macros in PLT, just so I won&rsquo;t need to explain the same thing once again.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in ER-macros, then you shouldn&rsquo;t read this.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>I&rsquo;m not claiming that ER macros are not respectable, I&rsquo;m just surprised at the knee jerk reaction to <code>syntax-case</code>.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>This is not an attempt at providing some portable library or even a PLT library. The intention is to show that <code>syntax-case</code>-style macros are &ldquo;as convenient&rdquo; as ER macros, if you really want to get down to that level.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>This is also not an attempt at any kind of formal claim of equivalence in any direction, only a demonstration that you can get the same kind of convenience.</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The bottom line here should be just the convenience point, addressed at people who like ER macros for that, and who think that <code>syntax-case</code> macros are somehow magical or that you lose the ability to play with S-expressions.</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>The important fact here is that while PLT&rsquo;s <code>syntax-case</code> macro system does not give you raw S-expressions, what you get is a simple wrapper holding them. A macro is a syntax transformer: a function that consumes a syntax value and returns one. For example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define-syntax))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define-syntax</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"n\">stx</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">#'</span><span class=\"mi\">123</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>is a macro that always expands to 123 (with <code>#'123</code> being the usual shorthand for <code>(syntax 123)</code>).</p>\n\n<p>A syntax object in PLT Scheme (the input to macro functions) is an S-expression, with some lexical information added — this includes the lexical context (in an opaque form), source location, and a few more things. To be more precise, a syntax value is a nested structure of wrappers holding lists and pairs, holding more wrappers, with identifiers at the leaves, where an identifier is a wrapper holding a symbol. It&rsquo;s easy to strip off all wrappers using <code>syntax-&gt;datum</code> if you like to work with S-expressions, but you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to strip it off of identifiers, since that will lose the important gravy. (In fact, the <code>defmacro</code> library works by stripping off all information, even from identifiers, then reconstructing it by trying to match names in the output form with the original input.)</p>\n\n<p>Instead of throwing away all information, what we want to do is preserve identifiers. We can use <code>syntax-&gt;list</code> for this: this is a function that takes a syntax value that contains a list, and strips off the top-level extra information leaving you with a list of syntaxes for the sub-expressions (returning <code>#f</code> if the input syntax does not hold a list). Once we have such a list, we can do the usual kind of processing with it, and when we&rsquo;re done turn the result back into a syntax using <code>datum-&gt;syntax</code> (which &ldquo;borrows&rdquo; the original input expression&rsquo;s information).

href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/larceny-users@lists.ccs.neu.edu/msg00097.html\">a post by Andre van Tonder</a> on the Larceny mailing list that uses a very similar approach and <em>does</em> make a library out of it. This is done by adding two arguments to the expected ER-transformation function — one is a <code>rename</code> function (since the above method uses <code>syntax</code> it is limited to immediate identifiers), and the other is always passed as <code>free-identifier=?</code>. Such a compatibility library is, however, not the purpose of this post.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is still a minor issue with this — PLT has an implicit <code>#%app</code> which is used wherever there are parentheses that stand for a function application — and in this code they are used unhygienically. This is usually not a noticeable problem, and if it is, you can add explicit <code>#%app</code>s. It might also be possible to find a more proper solution (e.g., use a hash table to keep track of lists that were disassembled by the client transformer), but at this point it might be better to just use the more natural <code>syntax-case</code> anyway.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>turing tarpit? next corner right and there you are ;)</p>\n\n<p>As you are quite aware, your &ldquo;solution&rdquo; changes the cost of macro-expansion to quadric. This is in constrast to linear cost for native syntax-case AND native ER-macros. As it is quite possible to implement syntax-case in terms of ER-transformers (or syntactic-closures) without loosing the linear complexity, many people claim that these two are more basic than syntax-case &hellip; and therefore should be in the actual standard.</p>\n\n<p>Whats your opinion eli?</p>\n\n<p>— <em>derSlom, 24 May 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>to also add useful something besides nitpicking, I have been down that road as well: http://paste.lisp.org/display/41754</p>\n\n<p>— <em>derSlom, 24 May 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know of any formal proofs of this, I don&rsquo;t believe that either ER or syntactic closures can express syntax case, nor can syntax case (in the original formulation) express ER.</p>\n\n<p>Also, ER really doesn&rsquo;t have a clear specification, so it&rsquo;s hard to make sure that an ER implementation that matches the original note works with actual code.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Sam TH, 24 May 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>derSlom: Yes, it is a demonstration of how to do ER-style for people who like that for the listed reason, and as a demonstration that syntax values don&rsquo;t require black magic, it&rsquo;s not a complete library. Expanding it into a library will require adding a hash table to (1) unwrap each syntax value once and get the cost loss back, and (2) to associate each unwrapped list with the lost syntactic information (which, I think, will also solve the `#%app&rsquo; problem). BTW, unlike your code, I&rsquo;m talking about a persistent hash, allowing you to add information to existing syntax values.</p>\n\n<p>Sam: that sounds right, but I explicitly avoided that too. I do think, though, that it&rsquo;s possible to express ER using something like the above &mdash; even with #%app.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 24 May 2009</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 130) f post (u .

Skiena and\nMiguel Revilla.  I thought it would be fun to show how to approach the problems\nusing the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) programming language.  Rather\nthan use a small, toy educational subset of the language, I’ll take off the kid\ngloves, and use whatever’s available in\n[#lang racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html).\n\n\n2</code>The problem:</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/100.html\">3n+1</a> problem is as follows: consider a positive number n. The cycle length of n is the number of times we repeat the following, until we reach n=1:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>If n is odd, then n ⇐ 3n+1</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>If n is even, then n ⇐ n/2</p></li></ul>\n\n<p>For example, given n=22, we see the following sequence: 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1. The cycle length of 22 is, therefore, 16, since it took 16 repetitions to get to 1.</p>\n\n<p>Given a definition of cycle length of a number, here’s the rest of the problem: given any two numbers i and j, compute the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, inclusive.</p>\n\n<p>2.1<code>The plan: \nBefore we do any real coding, let’s figure out a plan of attack and how to test\nthat plan.\n\n\n\n* We need a way of computing cycle-length.\n\n* We need to run cycle-length over a range of values and pick out the biggest result.\n\nIt sounds like we may want a function called cycle-length that will\ncompute how long it takes for us to get n to 1.

More to the point: repeated use of cycle-length can reuse prior results that we computed earlier. Maybe memoization will help. Let’s try it out: we’ll keep a small table of results, and consult that to see if we’ve already encountered the solution before.</p>\n\n<p>;We&rsquo;ll maintain a table of known results. &gt; (definetable(make-hash))</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(define(cycle-lengthn) (cond ;Consult the table: [(hash-has-key?tablen) (hash-reftablen)] [else ;If we can&rsquo;t find it, compute it&hellip; (defineanswer (cond [(=n1) 1] [(odd?n) (add1(cycle-length(add1(*3n))))] [(even?n) (add1(cycle-length(/n2)))])) ;&hellip; and then put it into the table.

That’s significantly better.</p>\n\n<p>We should make sure, of course, that all our test cases are running on this ok.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length1)1)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length2)2)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length4)3)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length5)6)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length22)16)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>All’s quiet on the cycle-length front. The tests are all passing.</p>\n\n<p>5.3<code>Advanced: abstracting memoization to a helper macro: \nIt turns out that the kind of memoization we’ve done here can be lifted out, so\nthat we can easily perform it at will.  That is, what we’re doing is something\nlike the following:\n\n\n\nGiven a definition that we’d like to memoize:\n\n\n\n* create a table for exclusive use by the definition, and\n\n* slightly tweak the definition’s body so it consults the table\nbefore going through computation.\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of Racket, we can say that like this:\n\n\n\n\n;A little helper to centralize the memoization logic\n;into a single rewrite rule:\n\n&gt; (define-syntax-rule(define/memo(nameid)body...)\n(begin\n(definetable(make-hash))\n(define(nameid)\n(cond\n[(hash-has-key?tableid)\n(hash-reftableid)]\n[else\n(defineanswer(beginbody...))\n(hash-set!tableidanswer)\nanswer]))))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis defines a small rewrite rule that expresses the idea of memoizing simple,\n1-argument function definitions.  Once we have this define/memo, we\ncan rewrite cycle-length to use it:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define/memo(cycle-lengthn)\n(cond\n[(=n1)\n1]\n[(odd?n)\n(add1(cycle-length(add1(*3n))))]\n[(even?n)\n(add1(cycle-length(/n2)))]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is nice because it’s easy to read.\n\n\n6</code>Cycling back to a loop:  Now that we have a fairly robust cycle-length function, we can do the rest of the problem. Given a range of numbers, we want to go through them, compute the cycle lengths, and pick out the biggest one.</p>\n\n<p>We can try to write this directly with a for/list to create a list of all the cycle-lengths, and apply the max across that list. Let’s write this in code:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(define(max-cycle-length-rangeij) (applymax (for/list([n(in-rangei(add1j))]) ;(add1 j) for inclusion &hellip; (cycle-lengthi))))</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Let’s write a few test cases to make sure that this is computing the right thing:</p>\n\n<p>;From the &ldquo;Sample Output&rdquo; section of ;http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/100.html &gt; (check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range110)20)</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>FAILURE name: check-equal? location: (eval 31 0 31 1) expression: (check-equal?

Much better!</p>\n\n<p>6.1<code>Advanced: maximizing a loop: \nIt would be nice if we could directly express taking the maximum\nacross a for loop.  We’re performing the maximum computation\nby first constructing a list of all the cycle lengths, then applying\nmax over the whole list.  Can we avoid that auxiliary list\nconstruction, and just compute the max as we’re running through the\nnumbers?\n\nIn fact, there are several variations of for loops in Racket,\nso maybe one of those variations will work for us.  For example, we\ncould use for/fold, which gives us enough expressive power to\ntake the maximum during iteration.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (for/fold([current-max-inf.0])\n([n'(31415926)])\n(if(&gt;ncurrent-max)ncurrent-max))\n\n\n9\n\n\nThere are other versions of for loops, such as the one for\ntaking sums (for/sum).  But as of this writing, there doesn’t\nseem to be be a for/max form that lets us take the maximum\ndirectly.\n\nThe question arises: how difficult is it to build for/max?\n\nIt turns out that it’s not too bad, though it requires a little more macrology:\nwe’ll use for/fold/derived to express our own for/max loop in terms of folding:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define-syntax(for/maxstx)\n(syntax-casestx()\n[(_clauses. defs+exprs)\n(with-syntax([originalstx])\n#'(for/fold/derivedoriginal\n([current-max-inf.0])\nclauses\n(definemaybe-new-max\n(let(). defs+exprs))\n(if(&gt;maybe-new-maxcurrent-max)\nmaybe-new-max\ncurrent-max)))]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, as we’re looping through numbers, we maintain a\ncurrent-max, and update that max accordingly as we walk\nacross the iteration.  The rest of the code in for/max\ndelegates the rest of the gruntwork to\nfor/fold (technically, for/fold/derived).\n\nWe must test this, of course:\n\n\n\n;Edge case: if we take the maximum of no numbers,\n;let's see -inf.0.\n\n&gt; (check-equal?(for/max([i'()])\ni)\n-inf.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max([i'(31415926)])\ni)\n9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max[(i(in-range123))]\ni)\n22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max([n'(3.141592.718281.61803)]\n[s'(-111)])\n(*ns))\n2.71828)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;... and of course...\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max[(i(in-range900(add11000)))]\n(cycle-lengthi))\n174)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks good.  With this, let’s express max-cycle-length-range\nin terms of for/max now:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define(max-cycle-length-rangeij)\n(for/max([n(in-rangei(add1j))])\n(cycle-lengthn)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7</code>Making a module:  Now that we have most of the solution worked out, let’s make a module that encapsulates what we’ve done.

Rather\nthan use a small, toy educational subset of the language, I’ll take off the kid\ngloves, and use whatever’s available in\n[#lang racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html).\n\n\n2</code>The problem:</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/100.html\">3n+1</a> problem is as follows: consider a positive number n.

Let’s try it out: we’ll keep a small table of results, and consult that to see if we’ve already encountered the solution before.</p>\n\n<p>;We&rsquo;ll maintain a table of known results. &gt; (definetable(make-hash))</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(define(cycle-lengthn) (cond ;Consult the table: [(hash-has-key?tablen) (hash-reftablen)] [else ;If we can&rsquo;t find it, compute it&hellip; (defineanswer (cond [(=n1) 1] [(odd?n) (add1(cycle-length(add1(*3n))))] [(even?n) (add1(cycle-length(/n2)))])) ;&hellip; and then put it into the table. (hash-set!tablenanswer) ;Don&rsquo;t forget to return the value back! answer]))</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Does the overhead of setting up this table pay for itself? Let’s see:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(time(for([i(in-range1100000)]) (cycle-lengthi)))</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>cpu time: 217 real time: 217 gc time: 44</p>\n\n<p>Hey, not bad at all! That’s significantly better.</p>\n\n<p>We should make sure, of course, that all our test cases are running on this ok.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length1)1)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length2)2)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length4)3)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length5)6)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(cycle-length22)16)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>All’s quiet on the cycle-length front. The tests are all passing.</p>\n\n<p>5.3<code>Advanced: abstracting memoization to a helper macro: \nIt turns out that the kind of memoization we’ve done here can be lifted out, so\nthat we can easily perform it at will.  That is, what we’re doing is something\nlike the following:\n\n\n\nGiven a definition that we’d like to memoize:\n\n\n\n* create a table for exclusive use by the definition, and\n\n* slightly tweak the definition’s body so it consults the table\nbefore going through computation.\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of Racket, we can say that like this:\n\n\n\n\n;A little helper to centralize the memoization logic\n;into a single rewrite rule:\n\n&gt; (define-syntax-rule(define/memo(nameid)body...)\n(begin\n(definetable(make-hash))\n(define(nameid)\n(cond\n[(hash-has-key?tableid)\n(hash-reftableid)]\n[else\n(defineanswer(beginbody...))\n(hash-set!tableidanswer)\nanswer]))))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis defines a small rewrite rule that expresses the idea of memoizing simple,\n1-argument function definitions.  Once we have this define/memo, we\ncan rewrite cycle-length to use it:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define/memo(cycle-lengthn)\n(cond\n[(=n1)\n1]\n[(odd?n)\n(add1(cycle-length(add1(*3n))))]\n[(even?n)\n(add1(cycle-length(/n2)))]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is nice because it’s easy to read.\n\n\n6</code>Cycling back to a loop:  Now that we have a fairly robust cycle-length function, we can do the rest of the problem. Given a range of numbers, we want to go through them, compute the cycle lengths, and pick out the biggest one.</p>\n\n<p>We can try to write this directly with a for/list to create a list of all the cycle-lengths, and apply the max across that list. Let’s write this in code:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(define(max-cycle-length-rangeij) (applymax (for/list([n(in-rangei(add1j))]) ;(add1 j) for inclusion &hellip; (cycle-lengthi))))</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Let’s write a few test cases to make sure that this is computing the right thing:</p>\n\n<p>;From the &ldquo;Sample Output&rdquo; section of ;http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/100.html &gt; (check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range110)20)</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>FAILURE name: check-equal? location: (eval 31 0 31 1) expression: (check-equal? (max-cycle-length-range 1 10) 20) actual: 1 expected: 20</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-failure\">Check failure</h2>\n\n<p>What?! Oh, whoops, I wasn’t using the n in the loop. Silly me. Let’s fix that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(define(max-cycle-length-rangeij) (applymax (for/list([n(in-rangei(add1j))]) (cycle-lengthn))))</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Thank goodness for test cases.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, let’s try that again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range110)20)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range100200)125)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range201210)89)</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>(check-equal?(max-cycle-length-range9001000)174)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>All passing? Much better!</p>\n\n<p>6.1<code>Advanced: maximizing a loop: \nIt would be nice if we could directly express taking the maximum\nacross a for loop.  We’re performing the maximum computation\nby first constructing a list of all the cycle lengths, then applying\nmax over the whole list.  Can we avoid that auxiliary list\nconstruction, and just compute the max as we’re running through the\nnumbers?\n\nIn fact, there are several variations of for loops in Racket,\nso maybe one of those variations will work for us.  For example, we\ncould use for/fold, which gives us enough expressive power to\ntake the maximum during iteration.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (for/fold([current-max-inf.0])\n([n'(31415926)])\n(if(&gt;ncurrent-max)ncurrent-max))\n\n\n9\n\n\nThere are other versions of for loops, such as the one for\ntaking sums (for/sum).  But as of this writing, there doesn’t\nseem to be be a for/max form that lets us take the maximum\ndirectly.\n\nThe question arises: how difficult is it to build for/max?\n\nIt turns out that it’s not too bad, though it requires a little more macrology:\nwe’ll use for/fold/derived to express our own for/max loop in terms of folding:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define-syntax(for/maxstx)\n(syntax-casestx()\n[(_clauses. defs+exprs)\n(with-syntax([originalstx])\n#'(for/fold/derivedoriginal\n([current-max-inf.0])\nclauses\n(definemaybe-new-max\n(let(). defs+exprs))\n(if(&gt;maybe-new-maxcurrent-max)\nmaybe-new-max\ncurrent-max)))]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, as we’re looping through numbers, we maintain a\ncurrent-max, and update that max accordingly as we walk\nacross the iteration.  The rest of the code in for/max\ndelegates the rest of the gruntwork to\nfor/fold (technically, for/fold/derived).\n\nWe must test this, of course:\n\n\n\n;Edge case: if we take the maximum of no numbers,\n;let's see -inf.0.\n\n&gt; (check-equal?(for/max([i'()])\ni)\n-inf.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max([i'(31415926)])\ni)\n9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max[(i(in-range123))]\ni)\n22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max([n'(3.141592.718281.61803)]\n[s'(-111)])\n(*ns))\n2.71828)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;... and of course...\n\n&gt; (check-equal?\n(for/max[(i(in-range900(add11000)))]\n(cycle-lengthi))\n174)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks good.  With this, let’s express max-cycle-length-range\nin terms of for/max now:\n\n\n\n\n&gt; (define(max-cycle-length-rangeij)\n(for/max([n(in-rangei(add1j))])\n(cycle-lengthn)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7</code>Making a module:  Now that we have most of the solution worked out, let’s make a module that encapsulates what we’ve done.

Reading the Scala documentation re its extensibility feature all I see is an ability to specify thunk arguments, and automatic thunking of expressions that are used for these arguments.

The answer to this question is a simple and definite &ldquo;no, it does not have the expressive power of macros&rdquo; &mdash; and that&rsquo;s for any macro system I know about (including non-sexpr macro systems, like CamlP4 or CPP).

The advantage that CamlP4 gives you over CPP is that it uses proper structures, which is also what you get with defmacro, so it&rsquo;s a good step in that direction.</p>\n\n<p>One techincal point here is that when working with it, I found that the types got in my way. The AST type is quite big, and evey piece of code must have many trivial cases. One solution to that was obvious: create an s-expr-like type, and translate the AST to that.</p>\n\n<p>Getting hygiene is also related to being integrated into the languaue, which is another thing you don&rsquo;t get with CamlP4. Transformations live completely outside of your code, so, for example, it is not possible to have libraries that provide new syntax transformers.</p>\n\n<p>This, combined with the heavy AST type mean that you need to do a <em>lot</em> of work for every transformation, which makes it more difficult to use. I don&rsquo;t see people going through all that just to implement a small debugging macro, or something simple like `when&rsquo; or a while loop.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, one thing I did when I worked with CamlP4 is to create a defmacro-like facility. It was limited in many ways: different AST nodes means that my macros would only work with AST subsets that make sense both as expressions and as patterns; the scope was in-file only; we needed to add facilities for including code etc etc. Still, it was much better than CPP (which was used for debug code), and even fixed a couple of bugs.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 9 May 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thanks for your comment. The way I usually use P4 is to define a small grammar for my extension, with a custom AST type for that. Then, I write a function to compile my custom AST into the Ocaml expression syntax. This matches how I write things on the whiteboard pretty well, and personally I found it more convenient than syntax-rules (which has a bizarre evaluation order).</p>\n\n<p>I do get really annoyed every time I have to define a gensym function &mdash; I should not have to do this in 2007! &mdash; and I take your point about the need for better language integration, because I have often wanted to write type-directed transformations. (For example, if you want to extend pattern matching and still check coverage, you need to know all the type and module definitions in the current scope.) You can&rsquo;t do this with P4.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Neel Krishnaswami, 10 May 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Let me preface my comment by saying that I think PLT Scheme is a wonderful language, and my thanks to the PLT folks for making it happen. With that said, I wanted to respond to these comments by Matthias:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because we support macros-as-abstractions, implementing classes, mixins, and traits as macros is not only feasible, it&rsquo;s a joy. Indeed, implementing an entire language, such as Arc is doable and is no just a toy (as it would be if implemented in a primitive macro system).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I heard from a reliable source that the current Arc implementation doesn&rsquo;t use scheme macros at all. So it perhaps is a bad example to use in this case.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Repl, 10 June 2007</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 131) f post (u .

It&rsquo;s all about the indentation to me.</p>\n\n<p>A while back I found that my <code>.emacs</code> file was growing in proportion to my Racket code&mdash;all of it I had ever written, in fact. Every new macro in my code or in the latest Racket version needed a line like: <code>(put 'for/fold 'scheme-indent-function 2)</code>This would tell Emacs <em>more or less</em> how I wanted it to indent the given form. So long as I followed the use patterns Emacs could cope with. For instance, with <code>for/fold</code>, Emacs could cope with both of the &ldquo;special&rdquo; arguments on the same line as the macro name, or both on separate lines. Changing that up got weird results.</p>\n\n<p>Also, function arguments would lead to significant rightward-creep in my indentation. Adding up the lengths of a list of strings, for instance, might look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/list..rkt)._foldl))\" style=\"color: inherit\">foldl</a></span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span>\n       <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n       <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/map..rkt)._map))\" style=\"color: inherit\">map</a></span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._string-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">string-length</a></span>\n            <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"There\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"are\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"thirty-four\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"characters\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"here.\"</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This wastes a lot of space on the left, and to me it doesn&rsquo;t do enough for readability to justify it. I don&rsquo;t need my eyes drawn to <code>0</code> and <code>+</code> nearly that much.</p>\n\n<p>I discovered a new style of indentation in the {_Little_, <em>Seasoned</em>, <em>Reasoned</em>} <em>Schemer</em> series of books by Dan Friedman and his many cohorts. These books always start a new indentation level at a fixed distance in from the previous one, regardless of the cause for the indentation. Arguments on the same line as the function or macro name are ignored; they do not &ldquo;push&rdquo; indentation over to the right at all.</p>\n\n<p>This indentation style has a lot of appeal to me for a number of reasons. One, it wastes no space on the left. Two, it never needs to &ldquo;know&rdquo; what a given macro means. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re applying <code>+</code> or <code>lambda</code> or <code>for/fold</code>, all lines beyond the first move two (or however many) characters to the right. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel: no more <code>.emacs</code> customization for every new form!</p>\n\n<p>This style leaves two issues. One, how to indent <code>cond</code>? The <em>Little</em> books treat <code>cond</code> differently, indenting each clause only as far as the keyword <code>cond</code>, while other form&rsquo;s arguments are pushed in slightly farther than the function or macro name. Two, how to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; forms like <code>for/fold</code> where a few lines really ought to be indented differently? A straight-up interpretation of this style would generate code like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._for/fold))\" style=\"color: inherit\">for/fold</a></span>\n  <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/sequences.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._in-list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">in-list</a></span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"12\"</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"characters\"</span><span class=\"p\">))])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._string-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">string-length</a></span> <span class=\"n\">str</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now we can&rsquo;t tell visually where the <code>for/fold</code> iteration clauses leave off and the loop body definitions and expressions begin.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>cond</code> issue is easy enough to resolve.

The same goes for a number of other repeated clauses, in fact: <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>syntax-parse</code>, and so forth. So I decided my new, custom indentation style would indent <code>[</code>brackets<code>]</code> differently from <code>(</code>parentheses<code>)</code>. Parens indent one farther than brackets.

It&rsquo;s all about the indentation to me.</p>\n\n<p>A while back I found that my <code>.emacs</code> file was growing in proportion to my Racket code&mdash;all of it I had ever written, in fact. Every new macro in my code or in the latest Racket version needed a line like: <code>(put 'for/fold 'scheme-indent-function 2)</code>This would tell Emacs <em>more or less</em> how I wanted it to indent the given form. So long as I followed the use patterns Emacs could cope with. For instance, with <code>for/fold</code>, Emacs could cope with both of the &ldquo;special&rdquo; arguments on the same line as the macro name, or both on separate lines. Changing that up got weird results.</p>\n\n<p>Also, function arguments would lead to significant rightward-creep in my indentation. Adding up the lengths of a list of strings, for instance, might look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/list..rkt)._foldl))\" style=\"color: inherit\">foldl</a></span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span>\n       <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n       <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/map..rkt)._map))\" style=\"color: inherit\">map</a></span> <span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._string-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">string-length</a></span>\n            <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">list</a></span> <span class=\"s2\">\"There\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"are\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"thirty-four\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"characters\"</span>\n                  <span class=\"s2\">\"here.\"</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This wastes a lot of space on the left, and to me it doesn&rsquo;t do enough for readability to justify it. I don&rsquo;t need my eyes drawn to <code>0</code> and <code>+</code> nearly that much.</p>\n\n<p>I discovered a new style of indentation in the {_Little_, <em>Seasoned</em>, <em>Reasoned</em>} <em>Schemer</em> series of books by Dan Friedman and his many cohorts. These books always start a new indentation level at a fixed distance in from the previous one, regardless of the cause for the indentation. Arguments on the same line as the function or macro name are ignored; they do not &ldquo;push&rdquo; indentation over to the right at all.</p>\n\n<p>This indentation style has a lot of appeal to me for a number of reasons. One, it wastes no space on the left. Two, it never needs to &ldquo;know&rdquo; what a given macro means. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re applying <code>+</code> or <code>lambda</code> or <code>for/fold</code>, all lines beyond the first move two (or however many) characters to the right. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel: no more <code>.emacs</code> customization for every new form!</p>\n\n<p>This style leaves two issues. One, how to indent <code>cond</code>? The <em>Little</em> books treat <code>cond</code> differently, indenting each clause only as far as the keyword <code>cond</code>, while other form&rsquo;s arguments are pushed in slightly farther than the function or macro name. Two, how to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; forms like <code>for/fold</code> where a few lines really ought to be indented differently? A straight-up interpretation of this style would generate code like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._for/fold))\" style=\"color: inherit\">for/fold</a></span>\n  <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/sequences.html#(def._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._in-list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">in-list</a></span> <span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"12\"</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"characters\"</span><span class=\"p\">))])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a></span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._string-length))\" style=\"color: inherit\">string-length</a></span> <span class=\"n\">str</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now we can&rsquo;t tell visually where the <code>for/fold</code> iteration clauses leave off and the loop body definitions and expressions begin.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>cond</code> issue is easy enough to resolve. In Racket, unlike in vanilla Scheme, we use <code>[</code>brackets<code>]</code> around <code>cond</code> clauses. The same goes for a number of other repeated clauses, in fact: <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>syntax-parse</code>, and so forth. So I decided my new, custom indentation style would indent <code>[</code>brackets<code>]</code> differently from <code>(</code>parentheses<code>)</code>. Parens indent one farther than brackets. That way,</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/let.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._let))\" style=\"color: inherit\">let</a></span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span><span class=\"o\">`</span><span class=\"ss\">doesn</span><span class=\"o\">'</span><span class=\"ss\">t</span> <span class=\"n\">become</span>\n\n<span class=\"o\">`</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/let.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._let))\" style=\"color: inherit\">let</a></span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"ss\">x</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n       <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"ss\">y</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._+))\" style=\"color: inherit\">+</a></span> <span class=\"ss\">x</span> <span class=\"ss\">y</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Since I already use <code>[</code>brackets<code>]</code> every time I have a repeated, non-expression clause, this rule does exactly what I need it to do.</p>\n\n<p>Once I had differentiated <code>[]</code> from <code>()</code>, resolving the <code>for/fold</code> issue was obvious. I needed a new indentation rule and a new lexical marker: <code>{</code>braces<code>}</code>. Now every time I have a <em>fixed number</em> of special non-expression forms in a macro, I wrap them in braces. Anything in braces is indented slightly farther (four spaces rather than two) than ordinary sub-expressions.

And indeed, as someone who is used to having this very visible structure, I find the two-space indentation for all arguments except for the first that is left on the first line much harder to read. Combined with multiple expressions on the first line I can see how this can get to be even worse (though not with simple \"+\" and &ldquo;0&rdquo;). (Obviously, you&rsquo;ll disagree as someone who is used to not getting these visual cues, which is why these are fertile flamewar materials.)</p>\n\n<p>In addition, IIUC, the curly brace thing is a way that forces you to specify stuff on each and every form, instead of making your editor know about these forms &mdash; and in that case it looks like a bad deal for me, sacrificing visual readability, and overall requiring me to do more work than adding one more name into my editor configuration.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Eli Barzilay, 28 September 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>re:Eli &mdash;</p>\n\n<p>Yep, this style definitely isn&rsquo;t for everyone, and it&rsquo;s definitely got some huge tradeoffs. I am acutely aware that I sometimes sacrifice the ability to easily tell how many arguments something has, and that&rsquo;s one place I&rsquo;m not sure I made the right decision. I am careful to only put multiple things on the same line if they&rsquo;re right after the function name, or in the case of functions like error or printf where I&rsquo;m just filling in values for the \"~a\" or \"~s\" escapes. Otherwise, after the first line, I definitely want a clear visual marker of how many arguments there are.</p>\n\n<p>As for the curly braces, I like that I have to put some thought into the indentation myself. The braces give more than just whitespace to say what&rsquo;s &ldquo;special&rdquo;. Frankly I&rsquo;m annoyed at how much extra duty () does, and I prefer making an explicit distinction.</p>\n\n<p>But I&rsquo;m definitely not trying to sway anyone here away from traditional Racket style, just presenting my own odd habits.</p>\n\n<p>— <em>Carl Eastlund, 28 September 2012</em></p>\n\n<hr />")) ((? . 115) f post (u .

In particular, it uses it in the higher-order context of <code>build-list</code>. This application also reuses useful third-party library functions like <code>foldr</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Such an application would be complicated to write in a traditional Web programming environment because the continuation of each <code>get-number</code> invocation is considerably more complex than is typical. Yet, the first-class continuations in Racket ensure that this continuation is captured exactly, correctly, every time.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the native first-class continuations of Racket are not serializable, so they impose a per-session resource expenditure on the server. This can be alleviated through <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/servlet.html#(part._managers)\">expiration policies</a>, but such policies are inherently unsound because continuations URLs are global roots.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, PLT has <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfgkf-web-restructuring-cps-journal/\">provided tools</a> that automatically restructure this kind of program into one that uses serializable continuations through an acronym soup of source transformations: CPS, lambda-lifting, defunctionalization, SPS, and so on. These tools effectively create automatically what most Web programmers write manually, except the tools don&rsquo;t mistakes. But the tools also don&rsquo;t take into consideration what functions actually contribute to the interaction context and transform library functions like <code>foldr</code> (which is unnecessary in the continuation) the same as functions like <code>build-list</code> (which <em>are</em> necessary.)</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/static/icfp065-mccarthy.pdf\">past work</a> (based on <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pcmkf-cont-from-gen-stack-insp/\">another PLT paper</a>) alleviates this problem by only requiring functions like <code>build-list</code> to be transformed. From the perspective of a programmer, &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; is tantamount to &ldquo;rewritten&rdquo; because the source code for a third-party library may not be readily available.

In particular, it uses it in the higher-order context of <code>build-list</code>. This application also reuses useful third-party library functions like <code>foldr</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Such an application would be complicated to write in a traditional Web programming environment because the continuation of each <code>get-number</code> invocation is considerably more complex than is typical. Yet, the first-class continuations in Racket ensure that this continuation is captured exactly, correctly, every time.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the native first-class continuations of Racket are not serializable, so they impose a per-session resource expenditure on the server. This can be alleviated through <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/servlet.html#(part._managers)\">expiration policies</a>, but such policies are inherently unsound because continuations URLs are global roots.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, PLT has <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfgkf-web-restructuring-cps-journal/\">provided tools</a> that automatically restructure this kind of program into one that uses serializable continuations through an acronym soup of source transformations: CPS, lambda-lifting, defunctionalization, SPS, and so on. These tools effectively create automatically what most Web programmers write manually, except the tools don&rsquo;t mistakes. But the tools also don&rsquo;t take into consideration what functions actually contribute to the interaction context and transform library functions like <code>foldr</code> (which is unnecessary in the continuation) the same as functions like <code>build-list</code> (which <em>are</em> necessary.)</p>\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/static/icfp065-mccarthy.pdf\">past work</a> (based on <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pcmkf-cont-from-gen-stack-insp/\">another PLT paper</a>) alleviates this problem by only requiring functions like <code>build-list</code> to be transformed. From the perspective of a programmer, &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; is tantamount to &ldquo;rewritten&rdquo; because the source code for a third-party library may not be readily available. Programmers would have to program <code>add-many-numbers.com</code> as:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <div class=\"pygments\">\n  <pre><span class=\"kn\">#lang </span><span
