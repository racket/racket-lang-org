  <h1>Racket v5.1</h1>
  </header>

<p><em>posted by Eli Barzilay</em></p>

<p>Racket version 5.1 is now available from <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">http://racket-lang.org/</a>The most significant change in version 5.1 is a <a href="../../2010/12/racket-version-5.html">rewrite of the GUI library</a>. Unix/X users will see the biggest difference with this change, because DrRacket and all Racket GUI programs now take on the desktop theme for menus, buttons, and other GUI widgets.</p>

<p>In the long run, Racket GUI programs on all platforms will improve as a result of the library rewrite. In the short run, beware that this first release of a new library will inevitably include a new set of bugs.</p>

<p>Version 5.1 changes in more detail:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The <code>racket/draw</code> library&mdash;which implements the drawing half the GUI toolkit&mdash;can be used independent of the <code>racket/gui/base</code> library and without a graphics display (e.g., without an X11 connection).The new library has one small incompatibility with the old GUI toolbox: &rsquo;xor drawing is no longer supported. The new library has many additional features: rotation and general affine transformations, PDF and SVG drawing contexts, gradients, and alpha-channel bitmaps.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The GRacket executable is no longer strictly necessary for running GUI programs, because the <code>racket/gui/base</code> library can be used from Racket. To the degree that a platform distinguishes GUI and console applications, however, the GRacket executable still offers some additional GUI-specific functionality (e.g., single-instance support).The new <code>racket/gui/base</code> library includes small incompatibilities with the old GUI toolbox: the <code>send-event</code>, <code>current-ps-afm-file-paths</code>, and <code>current-ps-cmap-file-paths</code> functions have been removed. The <code>racket/gui/base</code> library re-exports <code>racket/draw</code>, so it includes the same drawing functionality as before (except for &rsquo;xor drawing).</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The new <code>racket/snip</code> library can be used independently of <code>racket/gui/base</code> to work with graphical editor content (e.g., images in student programs). Like <code>racket/draw</code>, the <code>racket/snip</code> library is re-exported by <code>racket/gui/base</code>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The Web Server includes a backwards incompatible change that prevents X-expressions and lists of bytes from being directly returned from servlets. This change will increase performance for those types of responses and allow easier experimentation with response types. Please see "<code>collects/web-server/compat/0/README</code>" in the installation to learn about porting your servlets forward. Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s easy.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The new <code>raco demodularize</code> tool collapses a module&rsquo;s dependencies into a single module comprising the whole program. This transformation currently provides no performance improvement, but is the basis for cross-module optimization and dead-code elimination tools to come. The transformation is currently useful for static analysis of whole Racket programs.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The picturing-programs teachpack, formerly installed via PLaneT, is now bundled with the standard distribution. Use the teachpack with <code>(require picturing-programs)</code> instead of <code>(require installed-teachpacks/picturing-programs)</code>. The old PLaneT-based installation procedure still works, but it now merely installs a stub that invokes the bundled version.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Slideshow picts, <code>racket/draw</code> bitmaps, and images created with <code>2htdp/image</code> can now be used directly in Scribble documents. More generally, the new <code>file/convertible</code> protocol enables any value that is convertible to a PNG and/or PDF stream to be used as an image in a Scribble document.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The Same game sports a new look and an improved scoring system. (The current known high score is 12,429; can you beat that?)</p></li></ul>

<p>Wow, that was a bunch of work. I&rsquo;ve been lurking, trying the nightly build about every week. Congratulations on the successful rewrite and thank you for the effort.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for Racket! It&rsquo;s really great.</p>

<p>And could you help me? Does vim syntax file for Racket exist and how can I find one if yes?</p>

<p>— <em>ul, 22 February 2011</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;m using the Lion GM and can&rsquo;t seem to launch any of the binaries included in the download. They invariably crash on launch.</p>

<hr />

<p>Try a newer version &mdash; IIRC, there were some relevant fixes since then.</p>
