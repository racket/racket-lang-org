Thoroughly enjoyed this episode. When is the Racket book coming out? The online docs are great and the various books like PLAI and HTDP are wonderful, but I want more information on DSLs, continuations, hygenic macros and other advanced features of Racket that I probably don't even know exist.

The show was excellent... It really feels like the possibilities with Racket are unlimited :D

Nice! Looking at this video I just got an idea of how to populate Racket more:
With Screencasts!

Very illuminating... Incidentally this is the first FLOSS Video I've seen, and I loved it.

We're teaching the Principles of Programming Languages course here at our University in India using Racket... :)

Cheers!
