Racket version 5.3 is now available from


[http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)
Release Highlights:: 


* Submodules are nested module declarations that can be loaded and run independently from the enclosing module.  See also the [overview of submodules](../../2012/06/submodules.html).

* The futures visualizer is a graphical profiling tool for parallel programs using futures.  The tool shows a detailed execution timeline depicting the migration of futures between threads, and gives detailed information about each runtime synchronization that occurred during program execution.  In addition, `would-be-future` is a special type of future that always executes sequentially and records all potential barricades a regular future would encounter.

* Optimization Coach (formerly Performance Report) reports information about Racket's inlining optimizations.  Optimization Coach can be launched in any language through the View menu.

* The new `images/flomap` library defines floating-point bitmaps and fast image processing operations on them.  It is written in Typed Racket, so Typed Racket code may use it without the cost of contract checks.

* The new `json` library supports parsing and generating JSON.  (Originally based on Dave Herman's planet library.)

* `racket/string` is extended with a set of simplified string manipulation functions that are more convenient than using regexps.  `regexp-match*` and friends can now be used with new keyword arguments to return specific matched regexp group/s and gaps between matches.

* The new `racket/generic` library allows generic function definitions, which dispatch to methods added to a structure type via the new `#:methods` keyword.

* The `class` form supports declaring a method abstract.  An abstract method prevents a class from being instantiated unless it is overridden.

* The contract library comes with support for interfaces, generics, prompts, continuation-marks, and structs.

* Most error messages use a new multi-line format that is more consistent with contract errors and accommodates more information.

* Typed Racket supports function definitions with keyword arguments; the startup time of Typed Racket programs has been sharply reduced.

* The new `ffi/com` library replaces MysterX; a compatibility `mysterx` library remains, but without ActiveX support.  The new `ffi/unsafe/com` library offers a more primitive and direct way to use COM classes and methods.

* There is now a very complete completion code for zsh.  It is not included in the distribution though; get it at http://goo.gl/DU8JK  (This script and the bash completions will be included in the standard installers in future versions.)

Deprecation: 
Effective this release:


* The `tex2page` and `combinator-parser` libraries have been moved from the Racket distribution to PLaneT:

     (require (planet plt/tex2page))
     (require (planet plt/combinator-parser))

* The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the January 2013 release:

  the `planet` command-line tool; use `raco planet` instead.


* The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the August 2013 release:

  the `mzlib/class100` library; use `racket/class` instead.

Awesome guys. Thanks for the hard work on this!

The futures visualizer sounds very interesting!
