Racket version 6.6 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

* The new Macro Profiler command-line tool (`raco macro-profiler`) shows how macros contribute to the final expanded code size of a program.

* Typed Racket supports intersection types. This allows the type system to track more information, and for programmers to express more precise types.

* Typed Racket produces up to 4x smaller compiled files compared with Racket 6.5, reducing the size of the Racket distribution by 50M.

* Typed Racket issues warnings in cases where the contract generated for `Any` was not strict enough in the past. These warnings will become errors in a future release. Warnings are enabled via View -> Show Log in DrRacket, and shown by default on command-line Racket.

* Typed Racket enforces uses of `cast` more correctly, by checking both the "casted-to" and "casted-from" types. Previously, only the former were checked. In some cases, this will produce contract errors in programs that did not have errors before.

* `syntax-parse` raises an error when an ellipsis pattern has an empty match rather than diverging, and it logs a warning when it statically detects a nullable pattern, such as `((~seq) ...)`. In the next version of Racket, it will reject the pattern instead, and it will remove special handling that currently makes some uses of such patterns terminate.

* `htdp/dir`: The `create-dir` function delivers data information for files in a new field. The domain of its functions are backwards compatible.
