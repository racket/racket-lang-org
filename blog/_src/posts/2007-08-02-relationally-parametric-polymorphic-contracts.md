We've been making progress on the connection between types and
contracts.  This paper is a step towards answering the question, 
“What would polymorphic types (a la Standard ML) look like in a
contract world?”  If you haven't thought much about polymorphic
types, you may find the answer has some subtlety; if you have,
hopefully you will find the answer reasonable.



Arjun and I want to point out that some of the work in this
paper was already in an earlier paper that Jacob and Robby wrote, but
the material was excised from the public version, so we weren't aware
of it.  But there is some fresh material here as well, and anyway
Robby and I have been gabbing about this question for years.
