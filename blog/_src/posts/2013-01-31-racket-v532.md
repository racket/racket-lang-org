Racket version 5.3.2 is now available from
[http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)
Core Libraries:: 


* The new `math` library provides functions and data structures for working with numbers and collections of numbers.  Functions include non-elementary (such as gamma, zeta, Lambert's W), number-theoretic (factorization, modular arithmetic), linear algebra (arithmetic, decompositions), and statistical (expected values, order statistics, binning).  Data structures include arbitrary-precision bigfloats, probability distributions, and multidimensional arrays.

* The new `file/untar`, `file/untgz`, and `file/unzip` libraries support unpacking widely used archive formats.

* The new `lazy-require` form allows programs to delay the loading and instantiation of helper modules until they are needed.

* The new `data/bit-vector` library provides an implementation of bit vectors (a mutable sequence of booleans) supporting popcount.

* The `racket/generic` library allows the specification of default method implementations for core datatypes.

* The `openssl` library can verify hostnames and use the operating system's certificate store to verify certificates.

Package System:: 


* A new package system is in beta release.  This system will become Planet's successor.  It differs significantly from the latter.  For details, please read the documentation at [http://docs.racket-lang.org/planet2/](http://docs.racket-lang.org/planet2/) and list your packages on the new index at [https://pkg.racket-lang.org/](https://pkg.racket-lang.org/).

* The `raco test` command supports testing by collection and package, in addition to by directory and file, with the `-c` and `-p` options.

Teaching Libraries:: 


* batch-io: the read and write functions work on Unix-style standard input and output.

DrRacket:: 


* DrRacket's GUI is more responsive.

* The automatic parenthesis insertion mode is improved.

Scribble:: 


* Scribble renders Markdown format files via the `--markdown` command-line flag.  Example use case: Generate documentation hosted on GitHub or BitBucket.

* Documentation cross-reference information is stored in an SQLite3 database, which means that SQLite3 is required for building Racket documentation on Unix/Linux machines (but SQLite3 is included in Racket distributions for Windows and Mac OS X).
  
  Using a database for cross-reference information significantly reduces the initial footprint of DrRacket, since DrRacket no longer needs to load all cross-reference information.

Typed Racket:: 


* Typed Racket programs can require `plot/typed` to draw plots. List- and vector-accepting functions accept general sequences.

* Typed Racket supports Racket's delimited continuation and continuation mark operators.

Redex:: 


* Added more support for `define-judgment-form`, including random generation for well-formed judgments and visualization of judgments.

Deprecation:: 
The following have been removed in this release:


* the `planet` command-line tool; use `raco planet` instead.



The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the August 2013 release:


* the `mzlib/class100` library; use `racket/class` instead.
