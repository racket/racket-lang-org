PLT Scheme version 4.1 is now available from
  [http://plt-scheme.org/](http://plt-scheme.org/)

* DrScheme changes:
    * The Module language now has an automatically inserted `#lang` declaration, so the interactions window is available right away for new windows.
    * Searching is now interactive (see the manual for details).
    * Memory limits are now enabled by default.

* Typed Scheme supports a novel type checking mechanism for homogeneous and heterogeneous variable-arity function definitions and applications.

* Redex (a domain-specific language for testing operational semantics) is now included in the distribution. See also `[redex.plt-scheme.org](http://redex.plt-scheme.org/)`.

* Lots of improvement to the documentation, including: better searching, table-of-contents, and language-sensitive help (in the teaching languages).

* The world.ss teachpack no longer supports `end-of-time`, only `stop-when`.

* MzScheme has now a logging facility, search the documentationfor "logger" for more details.

* Bug fixes:
    * `begin` in R5RS (and derived languages),
    * `#lang planet`,
    * `eval` works with phases.

Feedback Welcome.
