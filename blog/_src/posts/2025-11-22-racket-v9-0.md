We are pleased to announce Racket v9.0 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

*** Racket 9.0 is here! ***

A major release is always exciting and Racket 9.0 is no exception in
that it introduces Parallel Threads. While Racket has had green threads
for some time, and supports parallelism via futures and places, we feel
parallel threads is a major addition.

## As of this release:

- Racket supports parallel threads. [For more information see the new blog post on the topic.](https:/blog.racket-lang.org/2025/11/parallel-threads.html)
    - Parallel threads can be created using the [`#:pool`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/threads.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._thread%29%29) argument to thread creation.
    - Threads created with
      [`#:keep`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/threads.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fbase..rkt%29._thread%29%29)
      set to `'results` will record their results for later retrieval
      with `thread-wait`.
- The [`black-box`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/black-box.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._black-box%29%29) wrapper prevents the optimizing compiler from optimizing away certain computations entirely. This can be helpful in ensuring that benchmarks are accurate.
- The [`decompile-linklet`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/linklets.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Flinklet..rkt%29._decompile-linklet%29%29) function can map linklets back to s-expressions.
- When using BC Racket, the [`processor-count`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/places.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fplace..rkt%29._processor-count%29%29) function is changed to always return the parallel count.
- We now distribute "natipkg" packages for AArch64, useful for package-build and package-testing infrastructure.
- Check Syntax tracks identifiers more deeply nested in the "origin" field of syntax objects.
- The `math` library includes [Weibull distributions](https://docs.racket-lang.org/math/Real_Distribution_Families.html#%28part._.Weibull_.Distributions%29).
- There are many other repairs and documentation improvements!
