PLT Scheme version 372 is now available from
[http://download.plt-scheme.org/](http://download.plt-scheme.org/)

This is mostly a bug-fix release.
Changes:

* DrScheme now supports name completion via Ctl-/ (Windows and X) or Cmd-/ (Mac OS X). Completion is sensitive to the current language in DrScheme, but it is not sensitive to lexical bindings.

* DrScheme's stepper now supports the "check-expect", "check-within", and "check-error" forms of the testing.ss teachpack.

* A number of bug fixes and small improvements for ProfessorJ. The grammar for the current release slightly differs from the one in HtDC.Feedback Welcome.

Hi...

Any chance we could have that cute little embedded test case back in DrScheme? I use it heavily for practice pieces and small projects.

I'm stuck on version 352 until then.

yours, Marcus

We have switched to a teachpack for student tests; see the mailing list archives for more details.
