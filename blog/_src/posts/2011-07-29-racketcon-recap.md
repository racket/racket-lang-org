We held [RacketCon](http://con.racket-lang.org/) here at [Northeastern](http://www.ccis.neu.edu/2011/) over the past weekend, and it was a great time! Matthew Flatt consulted his magic 8-ball about the future of Racket (it involves Hawaiian shirts); Matthias Felleisen announced the upcoming Realm of Racket book; Robby Findler demoed DrRacket with online syntax checking; Ryan Culpepper taught us how to make Rackety libraries; Prabhakar Ragde explained how the University of Waterloo teaches Racket and Program by Design to 1500 students a year (and how to embed math into Scribble documents).



Danny Yoo has already [blogged](http://blog.hashcollision.org/?p=162) about his talk about his [Whalesong](http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/) Racket->JavaScript compiler. Hopefully other people will write more about some of the individual talks; I'll update this post to link to any that I see.



As promised, the talks were videotaped by Jeff Dlouhy of the [NUACM](http://acm.ccs.neu.edu/); the videos are in post-production and should be up within a few weeks. We'll announce their availability on this blog. Slides from the individual talks will be up on the [RacketCon webpage](http://con.racket-lang.org/2011/) soon.
