Racket version 5.3.3 is now available from
[http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

This is a bug-fix release to address a flaw in DrRacket v5.3.2
concerning interactions between the contour window and the syntax
coloring.

The Racket home page is unusual in not having any sort of top-level "News" link. Perhaps it could have a direct link to the Blog? I was reduced to googling (though I could've found it under "Community", I later discovered). If it's considered there are already enough top-level links, you might consider removing "PLaneT", as it's not self-explanatory, and users who frequent it will presumably not go via the Racket home page (there are many quicker ways to get to PLaneT directly, and the home page's design looks, as it should be, newbie friendly with comprehensive navigation for experts who've lost their way, rather than efficient for regular expert use).
