We are pleased to announce Racket v8.14 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:

- 64-bit ARM Windows is one of the standard pre-built downloads.

- The `compiler/demod` language integrates demodularization into the
  program rather than an external tool. Using the language approach
  cooperates with other Racket tools and allows demodularization to be
  used on libraries. Additionally, demodularization handles submodules
  and can prune definitions, significantly shrinking the size of some
  programs.  ([`#lang compiler/demod`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/demod.html#%28mod-path._compiler%2Fdemod%29))

- The `contract-in` form enables contracts to be specified in an
  importing module. ([8.6 Attaching Contracts to Values](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/attaching-contracts-to-values.html#%28form._%28%28lib._racket%2Fcontract%2Fbase..rkt%29._contract-in%29%29))

- The `#%declare` form supports the `#:flatten-requires` and
  `#:unlimited-compile` keywords ([`#%declare`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/module.html#%28form._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._~23~25declare%29%29))

- Identifiers such as `case-λ`, `match-λ` and `λ` are equivalent to
  their Latin-alphabet equivalents (`case-lambda`, `match-lambda`, and
  `lambda`) in more contexts, including uses of `match`.

- The `hash-filter` function allows the use of a predicate to select a
  sub-table of a hash table. ([`hash-filter`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/hashtables.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fhash..rkt%29._hash-filter%29%29))

- The module browser can perform filtering on submodules.

- The `raco test` command-line form respects the
  `current-test-invocation-directory` parameter, and shows well-formed
  module paths in its output. ([`current-test-invocation-directory`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/test.html#%28def._%28%28lib._raco%2Ftesting..rkt%29._current-test-invocation-directory%29%29))

- Racket CS allows the use of in-memory boot files.

- The `raco/testing` collection brings together a variety of testing-
  related functions and forms. ([`raco/testing`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/test.html#%28mod-path._raco%2Ftesting%29))

- This release also includes many bug-fixes and documentation updates!

- NOTE: This release (and version 8.13) have a known build problem that
  affects the builtpkgs source bundle on Windows. In order to avoid this
  problem, use a pre-built bundle or build using a source bundle other
  than the "builtpkgs" one. Nightly builds do not suffer from this
  problem.
