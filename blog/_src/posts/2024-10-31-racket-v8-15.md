----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce Racket v8.15 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:

- Documentation search results are ordered, with visual cues
  indicating what their source is (core, main-distribution, etc.).
  These results are also grouped by language family (Racket, Rhombus,
  etc.). (e.g. [search `second`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=second))
  .)

- DrRacket offers to restore previously open files when starting,
  which can be made the default.

- In DrRacket, Images in editing panels can be saved by right-clicking, including those generated by the functional picture libraries [`pict`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pict/index.html) and [`2htdp/image`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html).

- `raco pkg` introduces the `uninstall` command as the opposite of `install`. The `remove` name for this functionality is retained for compatibility. (See [Package Management in Racket - 3.3 `raco pkg uninstall`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-uninstall%29).)

- `raco pkg` improves the handling of `--clone` and `--unclone`. (See [Package Management in Racket - 3.2 `raco pkg update`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/cmdline.html#%28part._raco-pkg-update%29).)

- iOS is a compilation target, distinct from macOS. (See [Inside:Racket C API - 29 Cross-compiling Racket Sources for iOS](https://docs.racket-lang.org/inside/ios-cross-compilation.html).)

- Racket supports falling back to IPv4 during hostname resolution when IPv6 fails.

- Memory allocated using the ffi/unsafe library can be initially zeroed, using the `'zeroed-atomic` and `'zeroed-atomic-interior` flags. (See [The Racket Foreign Interface - 4.2 Memory Management `malloc` *mode* `'zeroed-atomic` and `'zeroed-atomic-interior`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/foreign_pointer-funcs.html#%28idx._%28gentag._11._%28lib._scribblings%2Fforeign%2Fforeign..scrbl%29%29%29).)

- Many other bugs are fixed and documentation has been improved!
