Racket version 5.3.1 is now available from
[http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)
Racket:: 


* The `case` form dispatches on characters, fixnums, symbols, and keywords in logarithmic time.  (Thanks to Jon Zeppieri.)

* The new `racket/format` library provides new and improved string-formatting functions.

* Logging tools include improved filtering support based on the name of a logger.  A new `define-logger` form simplifies the use of named loggers.  Forms such as `log-debug` now support string formatting.

* The `for` forms now support `#:break` and `#:final` clauses.

* The new `PLTCOMPILEDROOTS` environment variable configures the search path for compiled bytecode.

DrRacket:: 


* Check Syntax now summarizes the documentation (i.e., the blue boxes) for the identifier at the insertion point in the top-right corner of the definitions window.

* Check Syntax now runs continuously for programs that declare their language within the source.  This mode has been available for several of the past releases, but now enabled by default.

* DrRacket can spell-check string constants (enable this in the Edit menu).

Typed Racket:: 


* Typed Racket interprets the `Any` type as a different contract. This may signal dynamic errors in some existing mixed typed/untyped programs.  The normal fix is to replace a use of `Any` with a more specific types.

* NaN is included in all of Typed Racket's floating-point types, which makes precise floating-point types easier to use.

* Typed Racket supports a `cast` operation with support for higher-order types.

* Typed Racket provides the `:query-type/args` and `:query-type/result` utilities to explore types at the REPL.

Miscellaneous:: 


* The `compatibility` collection provides features from Racket relatives, such as `defmacro` and mutable lists.  These features are provided to ease porting code to Racket.  Avoid them in modern Racket code.

* Screenshots of the widgets provided by the Racket GUI library are included in the documentation.  (Thanks to Diogo F. S. Ramos.)

* FrTime was ported to racket `#lang`.  (Thanks to Patrick Mahoney.)

Deprecation:: 
The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the January 2013 release:


* the `planet` command-line tool; use `raco planet` instead.

The following has been deprecated and will be removed in the August 2013 release:


* the `mzlib/class100` library; use `racket/class` instead.
