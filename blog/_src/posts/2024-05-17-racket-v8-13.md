We are pleased to announce Racket v8.13 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:

- The racket/treelist and racket/mutable-treelist libraries provide
  list-like containers that support many operations in effectively
  constant time, including appending and extracting sub-lists without
  mutating the given list. Treelists are implemented as RRB Vectors,
  invented by Stucki, Riompf, Ureche, and Bagwell. (see [4.16 Treelists](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/treelist.html#(part._treelist))
and [RRB vector: a practical general purpose immutable sequence, ICFP 2015](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2784731.2784739))

- The `hash-filter-keys` and `hash-filter-values` functions allow users
  to filter hashes using a predicate on either keys or values. (see [4.15 Hash Tables: `hash-filter-keys`, `hash-filter-values`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/hashtables.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fhash..rkt%29._hash-filter-keys%29%29))

- The `vector-extend` and `vector*-extend` functions provide a way
  to pre-populate the prefix of a newly allocated vector using the elements
  of an existing vector. (see [4.12 Vectors: `vector-extend`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/vectors.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fvector..rkt%29._vector-extend%29%29))
  
- Command-line raco setup, package update, and package installation use
  terminal control (when available) to show what they are working on
  more compactly and with a progress bar.

- Racket v8.13 uses Unicode 15.1 for character and string operations.

- Machine-specific cross-module optimization allows improved support for
  static generation of foreign-function bindings.

- The scribble/acmart language uses v2.01, which avoids errors
  concerning the hyperref package in some latex installations.
