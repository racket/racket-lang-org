Scheme Videos (Lectures and Talks)(thanks to Geoffrey Knauth and Hari)Following a mailing-list request, it turns out that there are quite a lot of Scheme-related lectures and talks floating around out there in video format. The following list was compiled by Geoffrey Knauth, with contributions from Hari and Michael Sperber, and at least one insertion from me, right at the front.
