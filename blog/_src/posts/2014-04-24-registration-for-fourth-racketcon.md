(fourth RacketCon) will be held on September 20th, and will be
co-located with [Strange Loop](https://thestrangeloop.com/) in St. Louis.



RacketCon is a yearly event where members of the Racket community get
together, featuring talks and demos about the things you do with Racket.



To get you excited, here's a sneak peek at the roster of speakers so far:





* Michael Fogus (keynote)

* Matthew Butterick

* Matthew Flatt

* Jay McCarthy

* Daniel Prager

* Neil Toronto

We still have room for more speakers. If you've built something cool
with Racket, we want to hear about it!
 
Hope to see you there!

Vincent, for the Racket team
