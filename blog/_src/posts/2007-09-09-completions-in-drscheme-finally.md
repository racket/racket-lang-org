DrScheme now supports a language- sensitive (but not lexical- scope sensitive) completion feature. Type <menukey>-/ and see what names are available to finish off the word you're typing. 


Thanks to [Jacob](http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~jacobm/) (and do follow that link; we all need a little more love in our lives) and [Mike](http://turingcompletewasteoftime.blogspot.com/) for taking the initiative to actually implement what is probably the most requested feature in DrScheme at the moment.
