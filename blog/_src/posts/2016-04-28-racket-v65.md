Racket version 6.5 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

* Typed Racket and the `racket/contract` library generate code with lower overhead, speeding up typed/untyped interaction in a number of gradual typing programs we studied.

* Macros written using `syntax-parse` automatically emit more accurate error messages.

* The contract profiler captures costs from more contract combinators, including all those in the main distribution.

* Hash table and set iteration, via both existing and new non-generic sequences, performs better, up to twice as fast on microbenchmarks.

* The Racket optimizer detects many more optimization opportunities, including when variables always hold numbers.

* The db library supports single-result CALL statements in MySQL.

* The `net/dns` library supports SRV records.

* The `racket/unix-socket` library supports listen and accept operations.
