PLT Scheme version 4.0.2 is now available from

  [http://plt-scheme.org/](http://plt-scheme.org/)
This release fixes a bug that caused PLaneT packages to install abnormally slow in 4.0.1.

[ For those that use the nightly builds, subversion, or 4.0.1tsrj2008, you already have this fix (and even more fixes). You do not need to upgrade.  The version in svn is now 4.0.2.3 to minimize confusion. ]

Feedback Welcome.
