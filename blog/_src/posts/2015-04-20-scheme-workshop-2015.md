Submissions must be in ACM proceedings format, no smaller than 9-point type (10-point type preferred). Microsoft Word and LaTeX templates for this format are available at: [http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm](http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm)



Submissions should be in PDF and printable on US Letter.



To encourage authors to submit their best work, this year we are encouraging shorter papers (around 6 pages, excluding references). This is to allow authors to submit longer, revised versions of their papers to archival conferences or journals. Longer papers (10--12 pages) are also acceptable, if the extra space is needed. There is no maximum length limit on submissions, but good submissions will likely be in the range of 6 to 12 pages.
