Racket version 5.3.5 is now available from
[http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)
This is a special-purpose release to match the arrival of “Realm of Racket” in bookstores.  Racket v5.3.5 adds a single `realm` collection to the v5.3.4 release.  The new collection contains the source code that readers of Realm may wish to use for experiments.
