PLT Scheme version 4.1.3 is now available from
  [http://plt-scheme.org/](http://plt-scheme.org/)
This is a bug-fix release.

Notable changes:


* Web Server:
* Documentation rewritten to separate servlet APIs and server extension APIs
* HTTPS supported on the "plt-web-server" command-line with "--ssl" option
* Stateless servlets supported in default configuration through 'stateless interface-version
* `web-server/servlet-env' supports top-level servlets through #:servlet-path
* Servlets are served from anywhere in the htdocs directory by default
* A template system based on the Scribble syntax has been added, see web-server/templates in the documentationAnd many other internal modifications to make extension easier!

[Note that mirror sites can take a while to catch up with the new downloads.]

Feedback Welcome.
