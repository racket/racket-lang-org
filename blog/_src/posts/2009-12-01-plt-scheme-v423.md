PLT Scheme version 4.2.3 is now available from  [`http://plt-scheme.org/`](http://plt-scheme.org/)

* The unit test framework for the teaching languages provides `check-member-of` and `check-range` for checking "random functions", i.e., "functions" that may produce several different results for one and the same argument.

* Added a new image library, `2htdp/image`.  Significant changes from `htdp/image`:

* copying and pasting does not introduce jaggies

* `equal?` comparisons are more efficient

* added rotation & scaling

* got rid of pinholes (new overlay, beside, above functions based on bounding boxes)

* The `scheme/vector` library provides common vector operations (also reprovided by `scheme`).

* The `scheme/promise` library provides several new kinds of promises with alternatives execution strategies.

* New port-reading utilities: `in-port`, `port->list`, `file->list`.

* A new require-macro, `path-up`, for 
requiring a file that is higher in the directory tree.
