Racket v6.2.1 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)



Version 6.2.1 patches the recent v6.2 release in three small ways:



* For the How to Design Programs teaching languages, DrRacket offers an option to use the old style for printing the constants `true`, `false`, and `empty` instead of `#true`, `#false`, and `'()`.

* The teaching languages come with some additional functions to match the August 2015 [stable release of HtDP 2nd edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html).

* A repair to the compiler avoids an infinite loop at compile time for certain expressions that should loop forever at run time.

Feedback Welcome
