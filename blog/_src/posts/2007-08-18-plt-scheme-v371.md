PLT Scheme version 371 is now available from

  [http://download.plt-scheme.org/](http://download.plt-scheme.org/)

This is mostly a bug-fix release.

Changes:

* The debugger now works across multiple files and supports "step over" and "step out" operations.
* HtDP teachpacks: the world.ss teachpack now exports two add-line functions: one from image.ss and one for adding lines to scenes.
* ProfessorJ now includes a language level between Intermediate and Advanced, Intermediate + access, that includes all of Intermediate and introduces access modifiers and overloading.  The language manuals contain the complete details.Feedback Welcome.
