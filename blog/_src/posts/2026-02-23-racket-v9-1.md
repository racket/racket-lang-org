----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce Racket v9.1 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:


* Documentation organization and navigation can be specialized by language family, to allow users to interact with documentation in a way that is tailored to that language family. This is currently used by Rhombus.
* The `for` form and its variants accept an `#:on-length-mismatch` specifier. [3.18 Iterations and Comprehensions: for, for/list, ...](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html)
* DrRacket improves the GUI for choosing color schemes.
* DrRacket has curved syntax arrows. The degree of curvature indicates the relative left- or right-displacement of the arrow's target.
* DrRacket's "Insert Large Letters" uses characters that match the comment syntax of the buffer's language, making it useful (and fun!) in Rhombus.
* The `exn-classify-errno` maps network and filesystem error numbers on various platforms to posix-standard symbols, to enable more portable code. [10.2 Exceptions](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._exn-classify-errno%29%29)
* The behavior of Racket BC on certain character operations (most notably `eq?`) is changed to match that of Racket CS, with a small performance penalty for these operations for BC programs. [19 Performance](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/performance.html#%28tech._bc%29) [1.5 Implementations](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/implementations.html#%28tech._bc%29)
* The `make-struct-type` procedure can inherit the current inspector using a `'current` flag. This is the default behavior, but there are situations in which it's not possible to refer to the current inspector. [5.2 Creating Structure Types](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/creatingmorestructs.html)
* Bundle configurations can better control the conventions for locating shared object files with the `--enable-sofind=<conv>` flags.
* The `system-type` function can report on platform and shared-object-library conventions with new flags. [15.8 Environment and Runtime Information](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/runtime.html)
* The `openssl/legacy` library makes it possible to access OpenSSL's built-in "legacy" provider, to get access to insecure and outdated algorithms. [OpenSSL: Secure Communication](https://docs.racket-lang.org/openssl/index.html#%28mod-path._openssl%2Flegacy%29)
* Typed Racket improves expected type propagation for keyword argument functions.
* There are many other repairs and documentation improvements!
