Racket version 6.7 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)

* Racket supports building graphical applications on Android through the `racket-android` project: https://github.com/jeapostrophe/racket-android

* The Racket REPL comes with line-editing, command and result history, and various meta-commands out of the box, via the `racket/interactive` module. See the `racket/interactive` and `xrepl` documentation for details.

* The package system supports authentication when installing packages from git, using the `raco pkg config git-checkout-credentials` configuration option.

* HTTP libraries, as well as `raco pkg`, support proxying via HTTP CONNECT.

* Typed Racket provides typed versions of `racket/os` and `racket/db/sqlite`.

* The `PLT_COMPILED_FILE_CHECK` environment variable provides more fine-grained control over when `.zo` files are consulted.

* The documentation search supports searching for `#lang`s and `#reader`s via the "L:" and "R:" search prefixes.

* The `file/glob` module implements globbing for path-strings.

* Optimizations in the bytecode compiler improve performance for structure, list, string, and byte-string operations.
