Racket version 6.2 is now available from [http://racket-lang.org/](http://racket-lang.org/)



With this release we are taking a major step forward to get our user community even more involved than in the past. Over the past six months, we have re-organized the Racket code base into a small core code repo and many other package repos, all found on GitHub. If you have time and if you wish to get involved, please take a look at the GitHub repos and find your favorite places to learn, fix, and enhance our world.



The core repo is at [https://github.com/plt/racket](https://github.com/plt/racket), and the package repos are listed at [https://github.com/racket/](https://github.com/racket/).



[core repo](https://github.com/racket/racket)



* The package manager supports a direct references to Git repositories via "git://[...]", "http://[...].git", and "https://[...].git" URLs. (Previously, only references to GitHub were supported.)

* A `--clone` option for `raco pkg install` or `raco pkg update` facilitates Git-based package development. If a package X has a Git repository source, installing and updating the package pulls from the repository in a read-only mode. Using `raco pkg update --clone X` switches the local installation to a repository checkout that is suitable for modifying the package implementation, issuing pull requests, pushing changes, and so on.

Using `raco pkg update --lookup X` switches the package back to the default installation mode.

[drracket](https://github.com/racket/drracket) 



* Its on-line check syntax works with graphical content.

* Increased availability of DrRacket's blueboxes, including method and constructor information.

* The "Open Require Path" menu item supports ".." in relative pathnames.

[data](https://github.com/racket/data) 



* Added `data/enumerate`, a library that supports efficient enumeration of data structures

[redex](https://github.com/racket/redex) 



* Its `redex-check` facility uses data (in addition to random) enumeration to try to find counter-examples.

* Its `generate-term` function accepts additional arguments to return the "i"-th member of a pattern using `data/enumerate` (meaning it efficiently supports very large values of "i").

* The examples collection includes Launchbury's 1993 big-step lazy semantics.

[htdp](https://github.com/racket/htdp) 



* `2htdp/image`'s polygon may be built out of bezier curves instead of just straight lines (see the docs for `pulled-point`).

* `2htdp/abstraction` is a teachpack for instructors and students who wish to use `for/*` loops, `match`, `define-type` and `type-cases` in ISL and ISL+.

* `2htdp/universe` programs can be exported using DrRacket's executable creation mechanism and they behave properly when run independently.

[typed-racket  ](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket)



* Typed Racket in DrRacket displays tooltips that show the types of expressions. Tooltips are also displayed for type errors.

* Typed Racket loads generated contracts only when needed. This reduces memory use and startup time for Typed Racket programs.

* Typed Racket has improved support for prefab structures, future semaphores, and async channels.

* Typed Racket understands when two different variables refer to the same thing, and updates types accordingly. This particularly improves the type checking of macros such as `match`.
