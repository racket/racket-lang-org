Many users often post to the `plt-scheme` mailing list asking for introductions to Web application development in PLT Scheme. They've heard of the continuation-based PLT Web Server and want a gentle introduction. Unfortunately, there has been a distinct lack of good documentation and tutorials for the server. Taking the cue from two users: [Jens Axel Soegaard](http://www.scheme.dk/blog/2007/01/introduction-to-web-development-with.html) and [David Reynolds](http://alwaysmovefast.com/category/plt-scheme/), we've written a tutorial with Danny Yoo.

The tutorial is available at [http://docs.plt-scheme.org/continue/index.html](http://docs.plt-scheme.org/continue/index.html). It walks through the creation of a blog application, introducing features slowly and culminates in an SQL-backed database for the posts. Of particular interest, is the [fast start servlet setup](http://docs.plt-scheme.org/web-server/insta.html) based on the Instaservlet package from [Untyped](http://www.untyped.com/).

Please take a look and pass along this as a pointer to those who may be interested in PLT Scheme.

If it is what I'm thinking, then you can get it at PLaneT. Search for it or its author, Danny Yoo (dyoo).
