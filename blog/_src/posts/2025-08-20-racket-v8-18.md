----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce Racket v8.18 is now available from [https://download.racket-lang.org/](https://download.racket-lang.org).

## As of this release:

- The [racket-lang.org](https://racket-lang.org) website no longer distributes Racket BC bundles, but it includes pre-built bundles for two flavors of ARM linux, AArch64 and 32-bit ARMv6 VFP.
- [XML structures](https://docs.racket-lang.org/xml/index.html) are serializable.
- [Scribble's](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html) HTML generation conforms better to modern standards.
- Racket uses Unicode 16.0 for character and string operations.
- The [`redex-check`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/Testing.html#%28form._%28%28lib._redex%2Freduction-semantics..rkt%29._redex-check%29%29) default generation strategy always uses random generation to supplement the enumerator.
- [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/editor.html) supports the use of shift-tab to go backward to previous indentation positions.
- The [macro stepper](https://docs.racket-lang.org/macro-debugger/index.html#%28part._.Macro_.Stepper%29) supports the [string-constants library](https://docs.racket-lang.org/string-constants/index.html), allowing internationalization of the stepper itself.
- The [`struct`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define-struct.html) form supports [`#:properties prop-list-expr`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define-struct.html#:~:text=The%20%23%3Aproperties%20option%2C%20which%20can%20be%20supplied%20multiple%20times%2C%20accepts%20multiple%20properties%20and%20their%20values%20as%20an%20association%20list.), making it more convenient to attach multiple property values to a structure type.
- Build-system improvements support containers registered at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/racket) to build for all platforms that have downloads from the main Racket download site; improvements also support Unix-style builds for Mac OS in the style of MacPorts.
- The [`expt`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._expt%29%29) function produces a more accurate result when its first argument is a flonum and its second argument is an exact integer that has no equivalent flonum representation than it did in prior versions.
- [TCP ports](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/tcp.html) use `SO_KEEPALIVE` correctly.
- Unsafe code can use [“uninterruptible mode”](https://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/Atomic_Execution.html#%28tech._uninterruptible._mode%29) instead of “atomic mode” to allow futures to run concurrently while preventing interruptions from other threads.
- The [`net/imap`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/imap.html) library supports [IMAP's `move`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/imap.html#%28def._%28%28lib._net%2Fimap..rkt%29._imap-move%29%29) operation.
- There are many other repairs and documentation improvements!
