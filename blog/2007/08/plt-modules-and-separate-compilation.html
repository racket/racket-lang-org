  <h1>PLT Modules and Separate Compilation</h1>

<p><em>posted by Richard Cobbe</em></p>

<p>For my summer job this year, I&rsquo;m programming in Common Lisp; this is the first time I&rsquo;ve used the language for anything more than toy examples. The experience has given me new appreciation for the PLT module system and how it enables separate compilation.</p>

<p>Lisp has a package system, of course, but it&rsquo;s not the same thing. It&rsquo;s primarily a tool to make sure that the symbols in one part of the program don&rsquo;t collide with the symbols in another part (unless you ask them to). Packages aren&rsquo;t about abstraction: while you can specify which symbols are exported from the package and which aren&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s just a suggestion that&rsquo;s not enforced by the language.</p>

<p>(You&rsquo;ll notice, by the way, that I used the word &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; and not &ldquo;identifier,&rdquo; which is the more common term in the study of programming languages, in the previous paragraph. That&rsquo;s deliberate: the Lisp package system works on symbols, not identifiers, so it also affects quoted, literal symbols. In my experience, this is sometimes helpful, sometimes a real pain, and usually completely unexpected. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.)</p>

<p>Also, there&rsquo;s no real relationship between Lisp packages and files. One package can be spread across multiple files, and one file can contain code in several different packages.</p>

<p>All this means that separate compilation in Lisp is a real problem. There is a system, ASDF, that attempts to address this need. (For more details, consult <a href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf">the closest thing to a homepage</a> that I could find for ASDF.) I&rsquo;m no expert on ASDF, but essentially the programmer specifies the dependencies between source files, in a set of files that exist parallel to the Lisp source. (ASDF does support grouping source files into larger chunks and specifying dependencies between those chunks, but as far as I can tell that&rsquo;s largely a convenience thing.)</p>

<p>The key thing for separate compilation, of course, is the dependencies. With ASDF, the programmer specifies those manually, and then ASDF basically does a topological sort such that if file a depends on file b, then ASDF ensures that a is compiled and loaded before b is compiled, and again before B is loaded. (This should start sounding a little familiar to folks who&rsquo;ve worked in the area where PLT&rsquo;s modules and macros intersect.)</p>

<p>So far, so good. Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with this setup. First, the dependencies between files are specified outside the language. This means that, if you happen to forget one, the results are not well-defined. If ASDF happens to choose an order that&rsquo;s consistent with the dependency you left out, everything will just work, and you won&rsquo;t have any indication that there&rsquo;s a problem. If, however, it doesn&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;ll get random &ldquo;undefined function&rdquo; and &ldquo;undefined symbol&rdquo; errors&mdash;if you&rsquo;re lucky (at least in SBCL, the implementation of Common Lisp that I use at my job). In PLT, by contrast, inter-module dependencies are part of the language, so the compiler will always give you an undefined-identifier error when it tries to compile a module in which you&rsquo;ve forgotten a require form. Big win, in my opinion (although we could argue about whether this should be an error or a warning, and whether the compiler should report lots of errors or just one before giving up completely).</p>

<p>Second, because ASDF lives outside the compiler, it can&rsquo;t be very smart about how macros affect separate compilation. I don&rsquo;t fully understand this, perhaps because the folks who&rsquo;ve been mentoring me at my job haven&rsquo;t thought it worth the time to explain it to me fully. But it appears that, if you change a macro that&rsquo;s used in other files, or change a function that&rsquo;s called by a macro at expansion time, you have to do the effect of a make clean in a distressingly large number of cases. This is a real problem when you&rsquo;ve got a large source base (~200K LOC, I think) and you&rsquo;re trying to speed up builds, as we are, and it&rsquo;s especially problematic if you&rsquo;re trying to run unrelated parts of the build in parallel.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly griped about the complexity of the interaction between PLT&rsquo;s modules and macros in the past. But after this summer, I have to say it&rsquo;s awfully nice to have a module system that Just Works for separate compilation. Nicely done, Matthew.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve pointed the folks at work at Matthew&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/macromod.pdf">ICFP 02 paper</a>, but as that technique requires a lot of support from the compiler, and we don&rsquo;t have the resources to add the necessary support to SBCL ourselves, I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;ll be more than a &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could do that?&rdquo;)</p>

<p>(Answer to rhetorical question in preceding paragraph: Yes. Yes it would.)</p>

<p>What exactly do you mean by random errors? If you get a &ldquo;undefined function FOO&rdquo; error that&rsquo;s a pretty clear indication that whatever file defines FOO should be defined as a dependency.</p>

<p>Also, if you wish to speed up compilation by determining precise dependencies between files in your system asdf-dependency-grovel might be a useful little tool.</p>

<p>I agree about the issue of macros &mdash; ASDF does not allow you to say &ldquo;this system exports a macro, and if the macro has changed, all downstream systems should be recompiled.&rdquo; This is left as an exercise to the reader, and I have certainly been caused severe pain by that.</p>

<p>WRT &ldquo;compiler support,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really agree with you. This is Common Lisp, after all, and I like the fact that ASDF works on SBCL and Allegro Common Lisp, etc.</p>

<p>Hellow. Could you please advice something like PLT but for SBCL. Sorry for the oftopic.</p>
