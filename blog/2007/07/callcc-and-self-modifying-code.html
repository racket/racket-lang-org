<p>It reminded of all the talk in the 1980s and 1990s that self-modifying code is bad. But look at the elegant assignment to <code>control-state</code> within its body. It&rsquo;s such a poem, I thought I&rsquo;d share it with people since nobody else blogs here anywya.</p>

<p>This is really beautiful. :)</p>

<p>— <em>Jianshi Huang, 28 July 2007</em></p>

<p>A pretty little ditty, to be sure. Much of object-oriented programming relies on self-modifying code, if you think about it. Consider the strategy pattern or the state pattern. In object-oriented programs it may appear that we are changing the data, but we are really changing the code.</p>

<p>Hello, a quick question:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a scheme guru, but the posted code seems a bit off. Specifically, it looks to me like &lsquo;return&rsquo; is only bound the first time generator is called, so if you used it like:</p>

<p> (generator)  &hellip;  (generator)</p>

<p>On the second call, it would jump back to the first call (since that&rsquo;s what the continuation stored in &lsquo;return&rsquo; is). It seems like it should instead be something like (totally untested):</p>

<p> &hellip;  (lambda (an-element-from-a-list)  (set! return  (call/cc  (lambda (resume-here)  (set! control-state resume-here)  (return an-element-from-a-list)))))  &hellip;</p>

<p>However, as I said, I don&rsquo;t write a lot of scheme, so maybe I&rsquo;m missing something.</p>

<p>Apologies for the terrible formatting, but I&rsquo;m not sure how to tell blogger to display stuff as code.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>— <em>Dan Doel, 28 July 2007</em></p>

<p>this is a terrible misuse of call/cc. here is a better implementation:</p>

<p>(define (one-at-a-time lst)  (lambda ()  (if (null? lst)  &rsquo;you-fell-off-the-end  (let ((x (car lst)))  (set! lst (cdr lst))  x))))</p>

<p>— <em>Gavin, 29 July 2007</em></p>

<hr />

<p>@Gavin: Actually, it is exactly what the recent call/cc hype was about: To allow implicit (foreach) instead of explicit state machines, esp. in the context of web applications. Imagine the state getting a little bit more complicated. (You&rsquo;d need to hide the call/cc in an abstraction for the generator programmer as well, though.)</p>

<p>— <em>Andreas Krey, 29 July 2007</em></p>

<hr />

<p>call/cc is indeed a bad choice if all you&rsquo;re doing is making a generator out of a flat list. However, the technique mentioned works about equally well for turning folds over arbitrary data structures into generators/cursors.</p>

<p>For instance, writing a generator for a binary tree using only the analogues to car/cdr is a pain (I imagine you&rsquo;d manage a stack of nodes to be visited by hand). However, writing an in-order traversal is simple. This example shows that you can turn the latter into the former automatically and generically using call/cc.</p>

<p>Of course, for the particular case of turning a fold into a cursor, delimited continuations are, perhaps, even nicer (and, in a sense, this example might be mimicking delimited continuations with call/cc + state). Something like:</p>

<p>(define (mk-generator traversal structure)  (define (generator) (control-loop))</p>

<p> (define (control-loop)  (reset  (traversal  (lambda (element)  (shift  (lambda (k)  (set! control-loop (lambda () (k #f)))  element)))  structure)  &rsquo;traversal-done))</p>

<p> generator)</p>

<p>Which, handily, avoids having to worry about keeping track of a return continuation for this problem.</p>

<p>The problem of turning folds into cursors in various languages, and the advantages of structuring a collection library in such a way are discussed in more depth here.</p>

  <p>Thanks for pointing out the bug.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>This (correct) code is a poem on turning a loop into a generator. It is not serious code.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>And yes, it is writing code like that many times, which first suggested delimited continuations to me in the fall of 1984; it just took three years to write it up.</p></li></ol>

<p>Matthias, sorry to be commenting on such an old blog post ;-)</p>

<p>This is a pretty cool example, but I think it would be clearer if the internal defines were desugared into a letrec. It&rsquo;s very odd to see a function definition mutated from inside the function in the first place, but somehow it seems more natural in a letrec. More importantly (for me at least), is that I can understand right away what the continuation of the letrec would be, but it&rsquo;s not at all obvious with the internal define &mdash; it looks as though the continuation of the (define (generator) &hellip;) code would continue by defining control-state again.</p>

<p>— <em>Michael, 30 January 2008</em></p>

<hr />

<p>This is cute; it took me a minute to understand what was going on. On the other hand, a few years ago I would have been scratching my head for hours.</p>

<p>One complaint though: this code holds onto a return continuation longer than necessary, introducing the possibility of memory leaks and/or poor GC performance.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of generic technique for destroying a reference to a continuation &ldquo;on the way out&rdquo; as you call it?</p>
